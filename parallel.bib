  abstract =  "Traditional compiler techniques operating on control flow
               graphs are not adequate for analyzing parallel programs where
               data can flow from one node to another through the shared
               memory, even though the nodes are not related by control flow
               edges.  Abstract interpretation provides a general and unified
               framework for program analyses, and can be applied to parallel
               programs without much difficulty.  However, the state space
               explosion problem in abstract interpretation of parallel
               programs must be relieved in order to make compile-time
               analyses practical.  Although abstract interpretation itself
               provides an excellent mechanism for state space reduction by
               state abstraction, lower precision analysis often results from
               taking a higher degree of abstraction.  In this paper, we
               present state space reduction that preserves analysis precision
               by eliminating redundant interleavings, based on Valmari's
               (1990) stubborn set method.  We also propose an iterative
               algorithm for analyzing programs with pointers and closures, in
               which knowledge about shared locations required by existing
               methods is not available.  The proposed algorithm has been
               implemented, and we discuss preliminary results of the
               implementation."
