   "The Android OS has emerged as the leading platform for SmartPhone
    applications. However, because Android applications are compiled from Java
    source into platform-specific Dalvik bytecode, existing program analysis
    tools cannot be used to evaluate their behavior. This paper develops and
    evaluates algorithms for retargeting Android applications received from
    markets to Java class files. The resulting Dare tool uses a new
    intermediate representation to enable fast and accurate retargeting. Dare
    further applies strong constraint solving to infer typing information and
    translates the 257 DVM opcodes using only 9 translation rules. It also
    handles cases where the input Dalvik bytecode is unverifiable. We evaluate
    Dare on 1,100 of the top applications found in the free section of the
    Android market and successfully retarget 99.99\% of the 262,110 associated
    classes. Further, whereas existing tools can only fully retarget about half
    of these applications, Dare can recover over 99\% of them. In this way, we
    open the door to users, developers and markets to use the vast array of
    program analysis tools to ensure the correct operation of Android
    applications.",
