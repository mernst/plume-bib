  abstract =
   "We argue that finding vulnerabilities in software components is different
    from finding exploits against them. Exploits that compromise security often
    use several low-level details of the component, such as layouts of stack
    frames. Existing software analysis tools, while effective at identifying
    vulnerabilities, fail to model low-level details, and are hence unsuitable
    for exploit-finding.
    \par
    We study the issues involved in exploit-finding by considering application
    programming interface (API) level exploits. A software component is
    vulnerable to an API-level exploit if its security can be compromised by
    invoking a sequence of API operations allowed by the component. We present
    a framework to model low-level details of APIs, and develop an automatic
    technique based on bounded, infinite-state model checking to discover
    API-level exploits.
    \par
    We present two instantiations of this framework. We show that format-string
    exploits can be modeled as API-level exploits, and demonstrate our
    technique by finding exploits against vulnerabilities in widely-used
    software. We also use the framework to model a cryptographic-key management
    API (the IBM CCA) and demonstrate a tool that identifies a previously known
    exploit.",

   "Blast is a model checker for C programs based on an algorithm called lazy
    abstraction. Specifications are given as temporal safety monitors written
    in C syntax. Blast starts with a very coarse predicate abstraction of the
    input program and automatically refines the abstraction, on-the-fly and
    on-demand, until either a bug is found or the specification is
    proved. Then, Blast provides either an error trace or a succinct proof
    certificate. Blast has been applied successfully to Linux and Windows
    device drivers with tens of thousands of lines of C code."

   "The goal of the SLAM project is to check whether or not a program obeys
    ``API usage rules'' that specify what it means to be a good client of an
    API. The SLAM toolkit statically analyzes a C program to determine whether
    or not it violates given usage rules. The toolkit has two unique aspects:
    it does not require the programmer to annotate the source program
    (invariants are inferred); it minimizes noise (false error messages)
    through a process known as ``counterexample-driven refinement''. SLAM
    exploits and extends results from program analysis, model checking and
    automated deduction. We have successfully applied the SLAM toolkit to
    Windows XP device drivers, to both validate behavior and find defects in
    their usage of kernel APIs."
