plume-bib:  collection of BibTeX bibliography files.

To obtain the bibliographies, run
  git clone https://github.com/mernst/plume-bib.git

This is a set of BibTeX bibliographies.  You can re-use them rather than
having to re-type or download.  Re-typing or downloading bibliography
entries is a notorious source of errors.  For example, even the ACM Digital
Library often has incorrect capitalization, or gives a SIGPLAN Notices
reference when the conference proceedings would be more appropriate.

Here are some other features:
 # Short and long versions of names, locations, and dates for conferences,
   journals, etc.  The short (abbreviated) version is convenient if your
   paper is nearing its page limit.  Changing between the two versions only
   requires a two-character change to your LaTeX file (see below), and no
   changes to any bib files.
 # Detailed dates.  Dates contain days of the month, which give the dates
   of just the appropriate track rather than the whole conference.  The
   abbreviated version omits the day of the month, though.
 # Consistent naming convention for citation keys:  last name of first
   author, followed by last initial of each other author, followed by
   year.  This makes the citation more recognizable in your LaTeX source,
   and avoids duplicates.
 # Searchable via the bibfind tool.  For instance, 
     bibfind keyword1 keyword2
   displays all the bibliographies with all the keywords, either in the
   entries in the comments.  (This is why there are no blank lines in the
   comments that abut some bib entries:  the search tool considers each
   blank line to start a new entry.  We may lift that restriction in the
   future.)

You can obtain the bibliographies by running the command
  git clone https://github.com/mernst/plume-bib.git
but you don't need to -- see below for how to set your build system to
automatically obtain and/or update a copy.

You can also set the PLUMEBIB environment variable to the location of your
clone (usually a directory named bib), so that you will have just one clone
rather than one for each paper you write.


USAGE
-----

To choose the abbreviated (short) or unabbreviated (long) version of the
bibliography strings, use one of these commands in your LaTeX file:
  \bibliography{bibstring-abbrev,...}
  \bibliography{bibstring-unabbrev,...}

When using the bibliographies, add near the top of your LaTeX document:
  \usepackage{url}
This defines the \url command used in the bibliographies.  To make URLs use
a slightly narrower font (the regular tt font is very wide), use:
  \usepackage{pslatex}
or, to use a smaller font, use:
  \usepackage{relsize}
  \def\UrlFont{\smaller\ttfamily}


EDITING AND ADDING ENTRIES
--------------------------

Changes, corrections, and additions are welcome.

When adding new bibliography entries, please use bibliography strings
rather than hard-coding conference/journal/institution names, locations,
and dates.  Add the new abbreviations to bibstring-master.bib as necessary.

For consistency, please start each new bibliography entry with "@" in the
first column, and end the entry with "}" or ")" on its own line.

If you make changes but you lack write access to the Git repository at
https://code.google.com/p/plume-bib/, then please submit a pull request, or
email a patch (a diff file) with your changes to Michael Ernst
<mernst@cs.washington.edu>.  Thanks for your contributions!


SETUP -- if you use a Makefile to process your paper
-----

1. Add "bib" as a dependency for the rule that calls bibtex; for example,
make "bib" a dependency for the myfile.bbl target.
2. Add "bib-update" as a dependency of your default target (such as "all").
3. Add the following rules to your Makefile.

export BIBINPUTS ?= .:bib

bib:
ifdef PLUMEBIB
	ln -s ${PLUMEBIB} bib
else
	git clone https://github.com/mernst/plume-bib.git bib
endif
.PHONY: bib-update
bib-update: bib
# Even if this command fails, it does not terminate the make job.
# However, to skip it, invoke make as:  make NOGIT=1 ...
ifndef NOGIT
	-(cd bib && git pull && make)
endif


SETUP -- non-Makefile version
-----

If you have previously cloned plume-bib and set the PLUMEBIB environment variable, there is nothing to do.  Otherwise, run this command:

  cd; git clone https://code.google.com/p/plume-bib/ bib

Then, set the PLUMEBIB environment variable to $HOME/bib and
add the "bib" directory to your BIBINPUTS environment variable.
  bash syntax:
    export PLUMEBIB=$HOME/bib
    export BIBINPUTS=.:${PLUMEBIB}:..:
  csh syntax:
    setenv PLUMEBIB $HOME/bib
    setenv BIBINPUTS .:${PLUMEBIB}:..:


SETUP -- miscellaneous details
-----

For the bibfind command, see
https://github.com/mernst/uwisdom/blob/wiki/README.md .
The bibfind command uses the "bibroot" file in the plume-bib directory.

If you wish to have only a single copy of the bibliographies on your
computer, you can clone the repository just once and set the PLUMEBIB
environment variable.  Then your Makefile will create (or you can make by
hand) a symbolic link from any directories where you are writing a paper.

Note for miktex users:
The bibtex that is supplied with miktex (the popular Windows implementation)
does not support the BIBINPUTS variable. You need to modify the miktex
configuration.  In file ...\miktex\config\miktex.ini, edit this entry:
 Input Dirs=searchpath 
(search path for BibTeX input files -- both databases and style files).


ALTERNATIVES: @string vs. crossref
------------

plume-bib's .bib files use @string for each of the fields of a containing
work such as a proceedings volume, as in:
  @string{FSE2011 = "Proceedings of ESEC/FSE 2011" = "ESEC/FSE 2011"}
  @string{FSE2011date = }
  @string{FSE2011addr = "Szeged, Hungary" = ""}
  ...
  @InProceedings{MyConferencePaper,
    ...
    booktitle =  FSE2011,
    year =       2011,
    address =    FSE2011addr,
    month =      FSE2011date,
  }

You could instead use BibTeX's crossref feature:
  @Proceedings{BrunHEN2011,
    ...
    title =      "Proceedings of ESEC/FSE 2011" = "ESEC/FSE 2011",
    year =       2011,
    address =    "Szeged, Hungary" = "",
    month =      sep # "~7--9," = sep,
  }
  ...
  @InProceedings{BrunHEN2011,
    ...
    crossref =   "FSE2011",
  }

This leads to a slightly smaller .bib file.  However, by default it
produces output like
  [1] Brun et al.  Paper title.  In [2].
  [2] Proceedings of ESEC/FSE 2011.  Szeged, Hungary, Sep. 7--9, 2011.

rather than the (usually) preferable
  [1] Brun et al.  Paper title.  In Proceedings of ESEC/FSE 2011.  Szeged,
      Hungary, Sep. 7--9, 2011.

You can get around this problem by passing the -min-crossrefs=9999
command-line option to BibTeX; for example:
  bibtex -min-crossrefs=9999 mypaper

Whereas plume-bib is written using the @string approach, it would be
possible to adapt it to accommodate the crossref approach, while retaining
the other benefits of plume-bib.  One advantage of the @string approach is
that it is less error-prone:  people commonly forget to use
"-min-crossrefs=9999" when running BibTeX.
