Directory of BibTeX bibliography files.

This is a set of BibTeX bibliographies.  You can re-use them rather than
having to re-type or download.  Re-typing or downloading is a notorious
source of errors in bibliographies.  For example, even the ACM Digital
Library often has incorrect capitalization, or gives a SIGPLAN Notices
reference when the conference proceedings would be more appropriate.

Here are some other features:
 # Short and long versions of names, locations, and dates for conferences,
   journals, etc.  The short (abbreviated) version is convenient if your
   paper is nearing its page limit.  Changing between the two versions only
   requires a two-character change to your LaTeX file (see below).
 # Detailed dates.  Dates contain days of the month, which give the dates
   of just the appropriate track rather than the whole conference.  The
   abbreviated version omits the day of the month, though.
 # Consistent naming convention for citation keys:  last name of first
   author, followed by last initial of each other author, followed by
   year.  This makes the citation more recognizable in your LaTeX source,
   and avoids duplicates.
 # Searchable via the bibfind tool.  For instance, 
     bibfind keyword1 keyword2
   displays all the bibliographies with all the keywords, either in the
   entries in the comments.  (This is why there are no line breaks in the
   comments, though we may lift that restriction in the future.)


USAGE
-----

To choose the abbreviated (short) or unabbreviated (long) version of the
bibliography strings, use one of these commands in your LaTeX file:
  \bibliography{bibstring-abbrev,...}
  \bibliography{bibstring-unabbrev,...}

When using the bibliographies, add near the top of your LaTeX document:
  \usepackage{url}
This defines the \url command used in the bibliographies.  To make it use
a slightly smaller font (the regular tt font is very big), do either
  \usepackage{pslatex}
or
  \usepackage{relsize}
  \def\UrlFont{\smaller\ttfamily}


EDITING AND ADDING ENTRIES
--------------------------

Changes, corrections, and additions are welcome.

When adding new bibliography entries, please use bibliography strings
rather than hard-coding conference/journal/institution names, locations,
and dates.  Add the new abbreviations to bibstring-master.bib as necessary.

For consistency, please start each new bibliography entry with "@" in the
first column, and end the entry with "}" or ")" on its own line.

If you make changes but you lack write access to the Mercurial repository
at https://plume-bib.googlecode.com/hg/, then please email a patch (a diff
file) with your changes to Michael Ernst <mernst@cs.washington.edu>.
Thanks for your contributions!


SETUP -- if you use a Makefile to process your paper
-----

1. Add "bib-update" as a dependency for the rule that calls bibtex.
2. Add the following rules to your Makefile.

export BIBINPUTS ?= .:bib

bib:
	hg clone https://plume-bib.googlecode.com/hg/ bib
.PHONY: bib-update
bib-update: bib
	cd bib && hg pull -u && make


SETUP -- non-Makefile version
-----

Obtain the bibliographies by running the command

  hg clone https://plume-bib.googlecode.com/hg/ bib

Then, add the "plume-bib" directory to your BIBINPUTS environment variable.
  bash syntax:
    export BIBINPUTS=.:PATHTOPLUMEBIB:..:
  csh syntax:
    setenv BIBINPUTS .:PATHTOPLUMEBIB:..:


SETUP -- miscellaneous details
-----

For the bibfind command, see http://code.google.com/p/uwisdom/wiki/README .
It uses the "bibroot" file in the repository.

Note for miktex users:
The bibtex that is supplied with miktex (the popular Windows implementation)
does not support the BIBINPUTS variable. You need to modify the miktex
configuration.  In file ...\miktex\config\miktex.ini, edit this entry:
 Input Dirs=searchpath 
(search path for BibTeX input files -- both databases and style files).
