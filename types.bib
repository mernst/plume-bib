   "This paper introduces techniques to detect mutability of fields and classes
    in Java. A variable is considered to be mutable if a new value is stored
    into it, as well as if any of its reachable variables is mutable. We
    present a static flow-sensitive analysis algorithm which can be applied to
    any Java component. The analysis classifies fields and classes as either
    mutable or immutable. In order to facilitate open-world analysis, the
    algorithm identifies situations that expose variables to potential
    modification by code outside the component, as well as situations where
    variables are modified by the analyzed code. We also present an
    implementation of the analysis which focuses on detecting mutability of
    class variables, so as to avoid isolation problems. The implementation
    incorporates intra- and inter-procedural data-flow analyses and is shown to
    be highly scalable. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
    the algorithms."

    enforce the owner-as-modifier discipline. This discipline does not restrict
    aliasing, but requires modifications of an object to be initiated by its
    owner. This allows owner objects to control state changes of owned objects,
    for instance, to maintain invariants. Generic Universe Types require a

    lifetime, reachability and context. We present a framework for processing

    optimizations so as to exploit immutability information. Preliminary
    experimental results show that a significant number (82\%) of read accesses
    could potentially be classified as immutable in our framework. Further, use
    of immutability information yields substantial reductions (33\% to 99\%) in
    the number of dynamic read accesses, and also measurable speedups in the

    pointers. This system separates mechanism (defining the semantics of
    sharing and exclusion) from policy (defining the invariants that are
    intended to be preserved). The capability system has a well-defined
    semantics which can be used as a reference for the correctness of various
    extended type systems using annotations. Furthermore, it supports research
    in new less-restrictive type systems that permit a wider range of idioms to

    practice), immutable objects are initialized in lexically scoped
    regions. The system is simple and direct; its only type qualifiers specify
    immutability properties. No auxiliary annotations, e.g., ownership types,
    are needed, yet good support for deep immutability is provided. To express
    object confinement, as required for class immutability in an open world, we
    use qualifier polymorphism. The system has two versions: one with explicit
    specification commands that delimit the object initialization phase, and
    one where such commands are implicit and inferred. In the latter version,
    all annotations are compatible with Java's extended annotation syntax, as
    proposed in JSR 308.",

   "We present \emph{Object Equality Profiling} (OEP), a new technique for
    helping programmers discover optimization opportunities in programs. OEP
    discovers opportunities for replacing a set of equivalent object instances
    with a single representative object. Such a set represents an opportunity for
    automatically or manually applying optimizations such as hash consing, heap
    compression, lazy allocation, object caching, invariant hoisting, and
    more. To evaluate OEP, we implemented a tool to help programmers reduce the
    memory usage of Java programs. Our tool performs a dynamic analysis that
    records all the objects created during a particular program run. The tool
    partitions the objects into equivalence classes, and uses collected timing
    information to determine when elements of an equivalence class could have
    been safely collapsed into a single representative object without affecting
    the behavior of that program run. We report the results of applying this
    tool to benchmarks, including two widely used Web application servers. Many
    benchmarks exhibit significant amounts of object equivalence, and in most
    benchmarks our profiler identifies optimization opportunities clustered
    around a small number of allocation sites. We present a case study of using
    our profiler to find simple manual optimizations that reduce the average

    typed languages. Tony Hoare has called this problem his ``billion-dollar
    mistake''. In the type system of ISO-standard Eiffel, the risk no longer
    exists: void safety (the absence of null pointer dereferencing) has become
    a property guaranteed by the type system and enforced by the compiler. The
    mechanism is fully implemented and major libraries and applications have
    been made void-safe. This presentation describes the principles of Eiffel's
    void safety, their implementation and the lessons gained.",

   "Precise type information is invaluable for analysis and optimization of
    object-oriented programs. Some forms of polymorphism found in
    object-oriented languages pose significant difficulty for type inference,
    in particular data polymorphism. Agesen's Cartesian Product Algorithm (CPA)
    can analyze programs with parametric polymorphism in a reasonably precise
    and efficient manner, but CPA loses precision for programs with data
    polymorphism. This paper presents a precise constraint-based type inference
    system for Java. It uses Data Polymorphic CPA, a constraint-based type
    inference algorithm which extends CPA with the ability to accurately and
    efficiently analyze data polymorphic programs. The system is implemented
    for the full Java language, and is used to statically verify the
    correctness of Java downcasts. Benchmark results are given which show the
    system performs very well: it is significantly more accurate and is nearly
    as efficient as CPA. The implementation itself contains a number of novel
    optimizations which proved necessary to achieve scalability."

   "Even though Java bytecode has a significant amount of type information
    embedded in it, there are no explicit types for local variables. However,
    knowing types for local variables is very useful for both program
    optimization and decompilation. In this paper, we present an efficient and
    practical algorithm for inferring static types for local variables in a
    3-address, stackless, representation of Java bytecode.
    \par
    By decoupling the type inference problem from the low level bytecode
    representation, and abstracting it into a constraint system, we show that
    there exists verifiable bytecode that cannot be statically typed. Further,
    we show that, without transforming the program, the static typing problem
    is NP-hard. In order to develop a practical approach we have developed an
    algorithm that works efficiently for the usual cases and then applies
    efficient program transformations to simplify the hard cases.
    \par
    Our solution is an multi-stage algorithm. In the first stage, we propose an
    efficient algorithm that infers static types for most bytecode found in
    practice. In case this stage fails, the second stage is applied. It
    consists of a simple and efficient variable splitting operation that
    renders most bytecode typeable using the algorithm of stage one. Finally,
    for completeness of the algorithm, we present a final stage that
    efficiently transforms and infers types for all remaining bytecode (such
    bytecode is likely to be a contrived example, and not code produced from a
    compiler).
    \par
    We have implemented this algorithm in the Soot framework. Our experimental
    results show that all of the 17,000 methods used in our tests were
    successfully typed, 99.8\% of those required only the first stage, 0.2\%
    required the second stage, and no methods required the third stage."

   "The design of GJ (Bracha, Odersky, Stoutamire and Wadler), an extension of
    Java with parametric polymorphism, was significantly affected by the issue
    of compatibility between legacy Java code and new GJ code. In particular,
    the introduction of raw types made it easier to interface polymorphic code
    with monomorphic code. In GJ, for example, a polymorphic class List<X>,
    parameterized by the element type X, provides not only parameterized types
    such as List<Object> or List<String> but also the raw type List; then, a
    Java class using List can be compiled without adding element types to where
    List is used. Raw types, therefore, can reduce (or defer, at least)
    programmers' burden of modifying their old Java code to match with new
    polymorphic code.
    \par
    From the type-theoretic point of view, raw types are close to existential
    types in the sense that clients using a raw type C expect some
    implementation of a polymorphic class of the same name C. Unlike ordinary
    existential types, however, raw types allow several unsafe operations such
    as coercion from the raw type List, whose element type is abstract, to
    List<T> for any concrete type T. In this paper, basing on Featherweight GJ,
    proposed by the authors as a tiny core language of GJ, we formalize a type
    system and direct reduction semantics of raw types. The bottom type, which
    is subtype of any type, plays a key role in our type-preserving reduction
    semantics. In the course of the work, we have found a flaw in the typing
    rules from the GJ specification; type soundness is stated with respect to a
    repaired version of the type system.",

   "Object immutability is a familiar concept that allows safe sharing of
    objects. Existing language support for immutability is based on immutable
    classes. However, class-based approaches are restrictive because
    programmers can neither make instances of arbitrary classes immutable, nor
    can they control when an instance becomes immutable. These restrictions
    prevent many interesting applications where objects of mutable classes go
    through a number of modifications before they become immutable.
    \par
    This paper presents a flexible technique to enforce the immutability of
    individual objects by transferring their ownership to a special freezer
    object, which prevents further modification. The paper demonstrates how
    immutability facilitates program verification by extending the Boogie
    methodology for object invariants to immutable objects. The technique is
    based on Spec\#'s dynamic ownership, but the concepts also apply to other
    ownership systems that support transfer."

                 (TAL) and present a type-preserving translation from
                 System F to TAL. The typed assembly language we present
                 is based on a conventional RISC assembly language, but
                 its static type system provides support for enforcing
                 high-level language abstractions, such as closures,
                 tuples, and user-defined abstract data types. The type
                 system ensures that well-typed programs cannot violate
                 these abstractions. In addition, the typing constructs
                 admit many low-level compiler optimizations. Our
                 translation to TAL is specified as a sequence of
                 type-preserving transformations, including CPS and
                 closure conversion phases; type-correct source programs
                 are mapped to type-correct assembly language. A key
                 contribution is an approach to polymorphic closure
                 conversion that is considerably simpler than previous
                 work. The compiler and typed assembly language provide
                 a fully automatic way to produce certified code,
                 suitable for use in systems where untrusted and
                 potentially malicious code must be checked for safety

    We present a generic framework that allows addressing this problem in two
    ways: through specifying verifiable source annotations to guide compiler
    analyses, and through optimistically using some assumptions and analysis
    results for the subset of the program seen so far. Two novel applications
    are presented, one for each of the above approaches: a dynamic optimistic

   "In this paper, we describe static analysis techniques for finding bugs in
    programs using the Java Native Interface (JNI). The JNI is both tedious and
    error-prone because there are many JNI-specific mistakes that are not
    caught by a native compiler. This paper is focused on four kinds of common
    mistakes. First, explicit statements to handle a possible exception need to
    be inserted after a statement calling a Java method. However, such
    statements tend to be forgotten. We present a typestate analysis to detect
    this exception-handling mistake. Second, while the native code can allocate
    resources in a Java VM, those resources must be manually released, unlike
    Java. Mistakes in resource management cause leaks and other errors. To
    detect Java resource errors, we used the typestate analysis also used for
    detecting general memory errors. Third, if a reference to a Java resource
    lives across multiple native method invocations, it should be converted
    into a global reference. However, programmers sometimes forget this rule
    and, for example, store a local reference in a global variable for later
    uses. We provide a syntax checker that detects this bad coding
    practice. Fourth, no JNI function should be called in a critical region. If
    called there, the current thread might block and cause a
    deadlock. Misinterpreting the end of the critical region, programmers
    occasionally break this rule. We present a simple typestate analysis to
    detect an improper JNI function call in a critical region.
    \par
    We have implemented our analysis techniques in a bug-finding tool called
    BEAM, and executed it on opensource software including JNI code. In the
    experiment, our analysis techniques found 86 JNI-specific bugs without any
    overhead and increased the total number of bug reports by 76\%.",

   "Most mainstream object-oriented languages, like C++, Java and C#, are
    statically typed. In recent years, untyped languages, in particular
    scripting languages for the web, have gained a lot of popularity
    notwithstanding the fact that the advantages of static typing, such as
    earlier detection of errors, are widely accepted. We think that one of the
    main reasons for their widespread adoption is that, in many situations, the
    ability of ignoring types can be handy to write simpler and more readable
    code.
    \par
    We propose an extension of Java-like languages which allows developers to
    forget about typing in strategic places of their programs without losing
    type-safety. That is, we allow programmers to write simpler code without
    sacrificing the advantages of static typing. This is achieved by means of
    inferred type constraints. These constraints describe the implicit
    requirements on untyped code to be correctly invoked. 
    \par
    This flexibility comes at a cost: field accesses and method invocations on
    objects of unknown types are less efficient than regular field accesses and
    method invocations. Also, our type system is currently more restrictive
    than it should be; its extension is the subject of ongoing work.

   "Starkiller is a type inferencer and compiler for the dynamic language
    Python designed to generate fast native code. It analyzes Python source
    programs and converts them into equivalent C++ programs. Starkiller's type
    inference algorithm is based on the Cartesian Product Algorithm but has
    been significantly modified to support a radically different language. It
    includes an External Type Description Language that enables extension
    authors to document how their foreign code extensions interact with
    Python. This enables Starkiller to analyze Python code that interacts with
    foreign code written in C, C++, or Fortran. The type inference algorithm
    also handles data polymorphism in addition to parametric polymorphism, thus
    improving precision.  Starkiller supports the entire Python language except
    for dynamic code insertion features such as eval and dynamic module
    loading. While the system is not yet complete, early numeric benchmarks
    show that Starkiller compiled code performs almost as well as hand made C
    code and substantially better than alternative Python compilers.",

   "Although the C-based interpreter of Python is reasonably fast,
    implementations on the CLI or the JVM platforms offers some advantages
    in terms of robustness and interoperability. Unfortunately, because the
    CLI and JVM are primarily designed to execute statically typed,
    object-oriented languages, most dynamic language implementations cannot
    use the native bytecodes for common operations like method calls and
    exception handling; as a result, they are not able to take full
    advantage of the power offered by the CLI and JVM. We describe a
    different approach that attempts to preserve the flexibility of Python,
    while still allowing for efficient execution. This is achieved by
    limiting the use of the more dynamic features of Python to an initial,
    bootstrapping phase. This phase is used to construct a final RPython
    (Restricted Python) program that is actually executed. RPython is a
    proper subset of Python, is statically typed, and does not allow dynamic
    modification of class or method definitions; however, it can still take
    advantage of Python features such as mixins and first-class methods and
    classes. This paper presents an overview of RPython, including its
    design and its translation to both CLI and JVM bytecode. We show how the
    bootstrapping phase can be used to implement advanced features, like
    extensible classes and generative programming. We also discuss what work
    remains before RPython is truly ready for general use, and compare the
    performance of RPython with that of other approaches.",

   "Many popular scripting languages such as Ruby, Python, and Perl
    include highly dynamic language constructs, such as an eval method that
    evaluates a string as program text. While these constructs allow terse
    and expressive code, they have traditionally obstructed static
    analysis. In this paper we present PRuby, an extension to Diamondback
    Ruby (DRuby), a static type inference system for Ruby. PRuby augments
    DRuby with a novel dynamic analysis and transformation that allows us
    to precisely type uses of highly dynamic constructs. PRuby's analysis
    proceeds in three steps. First, we use run-time instrumentation to
    gather per-application profiles of dynamic feature usage. Next, we
    replace dynamic features with statically analyzable alternatives based
    on the profile. We also add instrumentation to safely handle cases when
    subsequent runs do not match the profile. Finally, we run DRuby's
    static type inference on the transformed code to enforce type safety.

    We used PRuby to gather profiles for a benchmark suite of sample Ruby
    programs. We found that dynamic features are pervasive throughout the
    benchmarks and the libraries they include, but that most uses of these
    features are highly constrained and hence can be effectively
    profiled. Using the profiles to guide type inference, we found that
    DRuby can generally statically type our benchmarks modulo some
    refactoring, and we discovered several previously unknown type
    errors. These results suggest that profiling and transformation is a

    flexibility and prototyping. Class based languages are usually strongly
    typed and compiled, require a rigid class structure and class membership,
    and thus they support more robust, type safe programs.
    \par
    The two paradigms therefore address the needs of different stages in the
    programming lifecycle: object based programming better fits the earlier,
    exploratory phases, whereas class based better fits the latter,
    consolidation and maintenance phases. Because the transition from one
    paradigm to the other is not straightforward, programs tend to be developed
    in one of the two paradigms, thus foregoing the advantages of the other.

    We suggest that this need not be so, and that the benefits of the two
    paradigms can be combined: The earlier, exploratory, programming phases
    should take place in an object based setting. Then, the program should be
    incrementally annotated with types. Once fully typed, the program can be
    mapped onto an equivalent class based program.
    \par
    We demonstrate these ideas through the introduction of BabyJ, a
    formalization of Javascript. We define BabyJ$^T$, a typed extension of
    BabyJ. A permissive type in BabyJ allows the typing process to be
    incremental. We then define a meaning preserving transformation of

   "Assertions play an important role in the construction of robust software.
    Their use in programming languages dates back to the 1970s.
    Eiffel, an object-oriented programming language, wholeheartedly
    adopted assertions and developed the ``Design by Contract'' philosophy.
    Indeed, the entire object-oriented community recognizes the
    value of assertion-based contracts on methods.
    \par
    In contrast, languages with higher-order functions do not support
    assertion-based contracts. Because predicates on functions are,
    in general, undecidable, specifying such predicates appears to be
    meaningless. Instead, the functional languages community developed
    type systems that statically approximate interesting predicates.
    In this paper, we show how to support higher-order function contracts
    in a theoretically well-founded and practically viable manner.
    Specifically, we introduce lCON, a typed lambda calculus with
    assertions for higher-order functions. The calculus models the assertion
    monitoring system that we employ in DrScheme. We establish
    basic properties of the model (type soundness, etc.) and
    illustrate the usefulness of contract checking with examples from
    DrScheme's code base.
    \par
    We believe that the development of an assertion system for higherorder
    functions serves two purposes. On one hand, the system has
    strong practical potential because existing type systems simply cannot
    express many assertions that programmers would like to state.
    On the other hand, an inspection of a large base of invariants may
    provide inspiration for the direction of practical future type system

    to make a market of software components viable, however, producers and
    consumers must agree on enforceable software contracts.
    \par
    In this paper, we show how to enforce contracts if components are
    manufactured from class and interface hierarchies. In particular, we focus
    on one style of contract: pre- and post-conditions. Programmers annotate
    class and interface methods with pre- and post-conditions and the run-time
    system checks these conditions during evaluation. These contracts guarantee
    that methods are called properly and provide appropriate results.
    \par
    In procedural languages, the use of pre- and post-condition contracts is
    well-established and studies have demonstrated its value. In
    object-oriented languages, however, assigning blame for pre- and
    post-condition failures poses subtle and complex problems. Specifically,
    assigning blame for malformed class and interface hierarchies is so
    difficult that none of the existing contract monitoring tools correctly
    assign blame for these failures. In this paper, we show how to overcome
    these problems in the context of Java. Our work is based on the notion of
    behavioral subtyping.",

   "Static and dynamic type systems have well-known strengths and
    weaknesses, and each is better suited for different programming
    tasks. There have been many efforts to integrate static and dynamic
    typing and thereby combine the benefits of both typing disciplines
    in the same language. The flexibility of static typing can be improved
    by adding a type Dynamic and a typecase form. The safety
    and performance of dynamic typing can be improved by adding
    optional type annotations or by performing type inference (as in
    soft typing). However, there has been little formal work on type
    systems that allow a programmer-controlled migration between dynamic
    and static typing. Thatte proposed Quasi-Static Typing, but
    it does not statically catch all type errors in completely annotated
    programs. Anderson and Drossopoulou defined a nominal type system
    for an object-oriented language with optional type annotations.
    However, developing a sound, gradual type system for functional
    languages with structural types is an open problem.
    \par
    In this paper we present a solution based on the intuition that the
    structure of a type may be partially known/unknown at compile time
    and the job of the type system is to catch incompatibilities
    between the known parts of types. We define the static and dynamic
    semantics of a $\lambda$-calculus with optional type annotations and we
    prove that its type system is sound with respect to the simply-typed
    $\lambda$-calculus for fully-annotated terms. We prove that this calculus
    is type safe and that the cost of dynamism is ``pay-as-you-go''.",

    source to an intermediate type, followed by an upcast from the
    intermediate to the target---a threesome. Any chain of threesomes
    collapses to a single threesome, calculated by taking the greatest
    lower bound of the intermediate types. We augment this solution
    with blame labels to map any failure of a threesome back to the
    offending twosome in the source program.

    Herman, Tomb, and Flanagan (2007) solve the space problem
    by representing casts with the coercion calculus of Henglein
    (1994). While they provide a theoretical limit on the space overhead,
    there remains the practical question of how best to implement
    coercion reduction. The threesomes presented in this paper

   "\emph{Type inference} is the process by which an expression in an untyped
    computer language such as the lambda-calculus, Lisp, or a functional
    language can be assigned a static data type in order to improve the code
    generated by a compiler. \emph{Storage use} inference is the process by
    which a program in a computer language can be statically analyzed to model
    its run-time behavior, particularly the containment and sharing relations
    among its run-time data structures. The information generated by storage
    use information can also be used to improve the code generated by a
    compiler, because knowledge of the containment and sharing relations of
    run-time data structures allows for methods of storage allocation and
    deallocation which are cheaper than garbage-collected heap storage and
    allows for the in-place updating of functional aggregates.
    \par
    Type inference and storage use inference have traditionally been considered
    orthogonal processes, with separate traditions and literature. However, we
    show in this paper than this separation may be a mistake, because the
    best-known and best-understood of the type inferencing algorithms---Milner's
    unification method for ML---already generates valuable sharing and
    containment information which is then unfortunately discarded. We show that
    this sharing information is already generated by standard unification
    algorithms with no additional overhead during unification; however, there
    is some additional work necessary to extract this information. We have not
    yet precisely characterized the resolving power of this sharing and
    containment information, but we believe that it is similar to that
    generated by researchers using other techniques. However, our scheme seems
    to only work for \emph{functional languages} like pure Lisp.
    \par
    The unification of type and storage inferencing yields new insights into
    the meaning of ``aggregate type'', which should prove valuable in the
    design of future type systems.",

   "Ensuring the correctness of multithreaded programs is difficult, due to the
    potential for unexpected and nondeterministic interactions between
    threads. Previous work addressed this problem by devising tools for
    detecting race conditions, a situation where two threads simultaneously
    access the same data variable, and at least one of the accesses is a
    write. However, verifying the absence of such simultaneous-access race
    conditions is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure the absence of
    errors due to unexpected thread interactions.
    \par
    We propose that a stronger non-interference property is required, namely
    atomicity. Atomic methods can be assumed to execute serially, without
    interleaved steps of other threads. Thus, atomic methods are amenable to
    sequential reasoning techniques, which significantly simplifies both formal
    and informal reasoning about program correctness.
    \par
    This paper presents a type system for specifying and verifying the
    atomicity of methods in multithreaded Java programs. The atomic type system
    is a synthesis of Lipton's theory of reduction and type systems for race
    detection.
    \par
    We have implemented this atomic type system for Java and used it to check a
    variety of standard Java library classes. The type checker uncovered subtle
    atomicity violations in classes such as java.lang.String and
    java.lang.StringBuffer that cause crashes under certain thread
    interleavings."

   "Optimizing compilers for object-oriented languages apply static class
    analysis and other techniques to try to deduce precise information about
    the possible classes of the receivers of messages; if successful,
    dynamically-dispatched messages can be replaced with direct procedure calls
    and potentially further optimized through inline-expansion. By examining
    the complete inheritance graph of a program, which we call class hierarchy
    analysis, the compiler can improve the quality of static class information
    and thereby improve run-time performance. In this paper we present class
    hierarchy analysis and describe techniques for implementing this analysis
    effectively in both statically- and dynamically-typed languages and also in
    the presence of multi-methods. We also discuss how class hierarchy analysis
    can be supported in an interactive programming environment and, to some
    extent, in the presence of separate compilation. Finally, we assess the
    bottom-line performance improvement due to class hierarchy analysis alone
    and in combination with two other ``competing'' optimizations, profile-guided
    receiver class prediction and method specialization.",

   "The use of class libraries increases programmer productivity by allowing

    actual usage differs. We present an approach for rewriting applications to
    use customized versions of library classes that are generated using a
    combination of static analysis and profile information. Type constraints
    are used to determine where customized classes may be used, and profile
    information is used to determine where customization is likely to be
    profitable. We applied this approach to a number of Java applications by
    customizing various standard container classes and the omnipresent
    StringBuffer class, and measured speedups up to 78\% and memory footprint
    reductions up to 46\%. The increase in application size due to the added
    custom classes is limited to 12\% for all but the smallest programs.",

   "The use of type casts is pervasive in C. Although casts provide great
    flexibility in writing programs, their use obscures the meaning of
    programs, and can present obstacles during maintenance. Casts involving
    pointers to structures (C structs) are particularly problematic, because by
    using them, a programmer can interpret any memory region to be of any
    desired type, thereby compromising C's already weak type system.This paper
    presents an approach for making sense of such casts, in terms of
    understanding their purpose and identifying fragile code. We base our
    approach on the observation that casts are often used to simulate
    object-oriented language features not supported directly in C. We first
    describe a variety of ways --- idioms --- in which this is done in C
    programs. We then develop a notion of physical subtyping, which provides a
    model that explains these idioms.We have created tools that automatically
    analyze casts appearing in C programs. Experimental evidence collected by
    using these tools on a large amount of C code (over a million lines) shows
    that, of the casts involving struct types, most (over 90\%) can be
    associated meaningfully --- and automatically --- with physical
    subtyping. Our results indicate that the idea of physical subtyping is
    useful in coping with casts and can lead to valuable software productivity
    tools.",

    interfaces (i.e., the parameter lists calls to external functions), whereas
    K&R C does not. The experiment employs a counterbalanced design in which
    each of the 40 subjects, most of them CS PhD students, writes two
    nontrivial programs that interface with a complex library (Motif). Each
    subject writes one program in ANSI C and one in K&R C. The input to each
    compiler run is saved and manually analyzed for defects. Results indicate
    that delivered ANSI C programs contain significantly fewer interface
    defects than delivered K&R C programs. Furthermore, after subjects have
    gained some familiarity with the interface they are using, ANSI C
    programmers remove defects faster and are more productive (measured in both
    delivery time and functionality implemented).",

   "cJ is an extension of Java that allows supertypes, fields, and methods of a
    class or interface to be provided only under some static subtyping
    condition. For instance, a cJ generic class, C<P>, may provide a member
    method m only when the type provided for parameter P is a subtype of a
    specific type Q.
    \par
    From a practical standpoint, cJ adds to generic Java classes and interfaces
    the ability to express case-specific code. Unlike conditional compilation
    techniques (e.g., the C/C++ ``#ifdef'' construct) cJ is statically type safe
    and maintains the modular type-checking properties of Java generic classes:
    a cJ generic class can be checked independently of the code that uses
    it. Just like regular Java, checking a cJ class implies that all uses are
    safe, under the contract for type parameters specified in the class's
    signature.
    \par
    As a specific application, cJ addresses the well-known shortcomings of the
    Java Collections Framework (JCF). JCF data structures often throw run-time
    errors when an ``optional'' method is called upon an object that does not
    support it. Within the constraints of standard Java, the authors of the JCF
    had to either sacrifice static type safety or suffer a combinatorial
    explosion of the number of types involved. cJ avoids both problems,
    maintaining both static safety and conciseness.",

   "We present MJ: a language for specifying general classes whose members are
    produced by iterating over members of other classes.  We call this
    technique ``class morphing'' or just ``morphing''. Morphing extends the
    notion of genericity so that not only types of methods and fields, but also
    the structure of a class can vary according to type variables. This offers
    the ability to express common programming patterns in a highly generic way
    that is otherwise not supported by conventional techniques. For instance,
    morphing lets us write generic proxies (i.e., classes that can be
    parameterized with another class and export the same public methods as that
    class); default implementations (e.g., a generic do-nothing type,
    configurable for any interface); semantic extensions (e.g., specialized
    behavior for methods that declare a certain annotation); and more. MJ's
    hallmark feature is that, despite its emphasis on generality, it allows
    modular type checking: an MJ class can be checked independently of its
    uses. Thus, the possibility of supplying a type parameter that will lead to
    invalid code is detected early---an invaluable feature for highly general
    components that will be statically instantiated by other programmers.",

    type-checker itself does not produce the messages. Instead, it is an oracle
    for a search procedure that finds similar programs that do type-check. Our
    two-fold goal is to improve error messages while simplifying compiler
    construction.
    \par
    Our primary implementation and evaluation is for Caml, a language with full

   "We present an overview of JTL (the Java Tools Language, pronounced
    ``Gee-tel''), a novel language for querying Java [8] programs. JTL was
    designed to serve the development of source code software tools for Java,
    and as a small language which to aid programming language extensions to
    Java. Applications include definition of pointcuts for aspect-oriented
    programming, fixing type constraints for generic programming, specification
    of encapsulation policies, definition of micro-patterns, etc. We argue that
    the JTL expression of each of these is systematic, concise, intuitive and
    general.
    \par
    JTL relies on a simply-typed relational database for program
    representation, rather than an abstract syntax tree. The underlying
    semantics of the language is restricted to queries formulated in First
    Order Predicate Logic augmented with transitive closure (FOPL*).
    \par
    Special effort was taken to ensure terse, yet readable expression of
    logical conditions. The JTL pattern \texttt{public abstract class}, for
    example, matches all abstract classes which are publicly accessible, while
    \texttt{class (public clone();)} matches all classes in which method clone
    is public. To this end, JTL relies on a Datalog-like syntax and semantics,
    enriched with quantifiers and pattern matching which all but entirely
    eliminate the need for recursive calls.
    \par
    JTL's query analyzer gives special attention to the fragility of the
    ``closed world assumption'' in examining Java software, and determines
    whether a query relies on such an assumption.
    \par
    The performance of the JTL interpreter is comparable to that of JQuery
    after it generated its database cache, and at least an order of magnitude
    faster when the cache has to be rebuilt.",

    insights and recommendations to stakeholders. They typically use office
    tools, which give great freedom, but no help with consistency management,
    change propagation, or information migration to downstream tools. Despite
    these downsides, office tools are still favored over modeling tools, which
    are constraining and difficult to use. We introduce the notion of flexible
    modeling tools, which blend the advantages of office and modeling tools. We
    propose a conceptual architecture for such tools, and outline research
    challenges to be met in realizing them. We briefly describe the Business
    Insight Toolkit, a prototype tool embodying this architecture."
