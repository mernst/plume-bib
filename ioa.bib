   "IOA is a high-level distributed programming language based on the
    formal I/O automaton model for asynchronous concurrent systems. A suite
    of software tools, called the IOA toolkit, has been designed and
    partially implemented to facilitate the analysis and verification of
    distributed systems using techniques supported by the formal model. An
    important proof technique for distributed systems defined by a
    hierarchy of abstractions involves the notion of a simulation relation
    between pairs of automata at different levels in the hierarchy. The IOA
    toolkit's simulator tests purported simulation relations by executing
    the low-level automaton and, given a proposed correspondence between
    its steps and those of the higher-level automaton, generating and
    checking an execution of the higher-level automaton. Once checked by
    the simulator, the simulation relation and the step correspondence can
    be used in conjunction with the toolkit's proof tools to construct a
    formal proof that the low-level automaton implements the higher-level
    one. This paper presents a case study that illustrates this use of the
    IOA toolkit to prove correct an algorithm for mutual exclusion. The
    case study shows how tools like the IOA simulator can play an important
    role in proving distributed systems correct."

   "The paper presents a method for the automatic verification of a certain
    class of parameterized systems. These are {\em bounded-data} systems
    consisting of N processes (N being the parameter), where each process
    is finite-state. First, we show that if we use the standard deductive
    {\sc inv} rule for proving invariance properties, then all the
    generated verification conditions can be automatically resolved by
    finite-state ({\sc bdd}-based) methods with no need for interactive
    theorem proving.
    \par
    Next, we show how to use model-checking techniques over finite (and small)
    instances of the parameterized system in order to derive candidates for
    invariant assertions. Combining this automatic computation of invariants
    with the previously mentioned resolution of the VCs (verification
    conditions) yields a (necessarily) incomplete but fully automatic sound
    method for verifying bounded-data parameterized systems. The generated
    invariants can be transferred to the VC-validation phase without ever been
    examined by the user, which explains why we refer to them as ``invisible''.
    \par
    We illustrate the method on a non-trivial example of a cache
    protocol, provided by Steve German.",
