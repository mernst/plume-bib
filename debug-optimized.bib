  abstract =     "To develop a theory of computer program bugs and of
                 debugging, we need to classify on an abstract basis the
                 nature of the bug and to relate the nature of the bug
                 to the difficulty of debugging. Atwood and Ramsey
                 (1978) report the only attempt of this nature in a
                 study based on the theory of propositional hierarchies
                 (see Kintsch, 1974) from the text comprehension
                 literature. Propositional hierarchies are a
                 conceptualization of the way in which sentences are
                 stored in memory for the purpose of recall, etc. Atwood
                 and Ramsey's studies did not distinguish between the
                 difficulty of debugging as a function of the location
                 of the bug in the propositional hierarchy or the
                 location of the bug in the program structure. The
                 objective of the series of three studies reported here
                 is to differentiate between bug difficulty based on
                 location in the propositional hierarchy of the sentence
                 structure of the programming language and its location
                 in the serial structure of the program. Little support
                 was found for the effect of the location of the bug in
                 the program structure on debugging difficulty. The
                 effect of the location of the bug in the propositional
                 hierarchy warrants further investigation. The results
                 are interpreted in light of the need to formulate a
                 mental model of correct program functioning and to
                 determine the location of the program bug in terms of
                 the functioning of that model.",
