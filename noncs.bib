   "In primary and secondary education, measures of teacher quality are often
    based on contemporaneous student performance on standardized achievement
    tests. In the postsecondary environment, scores on student evaluations of
    professors are typically used to measure teaching quality. We possess
    unique data that allow us to measure relative student performance in
    mandatory follow‐on classes. We compare metrics that capture these three
    different notions of instructional quality and present evidence that
    professors who excel at promoting contemporaneous student achievement teach
    in ways that improve their student evaluations but harm the follow‐on
    achievement of their students in more advanced classes.",

   "The present study explored the effects of lecture fluency on students’
    metacognitive awareness and regulation. Participants watched one of two
    short videos of an instructor explaining a scientific concept. In the
    fluent video, the instructor stood upright, maintained eye contact, and
    spoke fluidly without notes. In the disfluent video, the instructor
    slumped, looked away, and spoke haltingly with notes. After watching the
    video, participants in Experiment 1 were asked to predict how much of the
    content they would later be able to recall, and participants in Experiment
    2 were given a text-based script of the video to study. Perceived learning
    was significantly higher for the fluent instructor than for the disfluent
    instructor (Experiment 1), although study time was not significantly
    affected by lecture fluency (Experiment 2). In both experiments, the fluent
    instructor was rated significantly higher than the disfluent instructor on
    traditional instructor evaluation questions, such as preparedness and
    effectiveness. However, in both experiments, lecture fluency did not
    significantly affect the amount of information learned. Thus, students’
    perceptions of their own learning and an instructor’s effectiveness appear
    to be based on lecture fluency and not on actual learning.",
