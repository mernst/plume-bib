   "In primary and secondary education, measures of teacher quality are often
    based on contemporaneous student performance on standardized achievement
    tests. In the postsecondary environment, scores on student evaluations of
    professors are typically used to measure teaching quality. We possess
    unique data that allow us to measure relative student performance in
    mandatory follow‐on classes. We compare metrics that capture these three
    different notions of instructional quality and present evidence that
    professors who excel at promoting contemporaneous student achievement teach
    in ways that improve their student evaluations but harm the follow‐on
    achievement of their students in more advanced classes.",
