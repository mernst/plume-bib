  abstract =
   "Traceroute is the most widely used Internet diagnostic tool today. Network
    operators use it to help identify routing failures, poor performance, and
    router misconfigurations.  Researchers use it to map the Internet, predict
    performance, geolocate routers, and classify the performance of
    ISPs. However, traceroute has a fundamental limitation that affects all
    these applications: it does not provide reverse path information. Although
    various public traceroute servers across the Internet provide some
    visibility, no general method exists for determining a reverse path from an
    arbitrary destination.
    \par
    In this paper, we address this longstanding limitation by building a
    reverse traceroute system. Our system provides the same information as
    traceroute, but for the reverse path, and it works in the same case as
    traceroute, when the user may lack control of the destination. We use a
    variety of measurement techniques to incrementally piece together the path
    from the destination back to the source. We deploy our system on PlanetLab
    and compare reverse traceroute paths with traceroutes issued from the
    destinations. In the median case our tool finds 87\% of the hops seen in a
    directly measured traceroute along the same path, versus only 38\% if one
    simply assumes the path is symmetric, a common fallback given the lack of
    available tools. We then illustrate how we can use our reverse traceroute
    system to study previously unmeasurable aspects of the Internet: we present
    a case study of how a content provider could use our tool to troubleshoot
    poor path performance, we uncover more than a thousand peer-to-peer AS
    links invisible to current topology mapping efforts, and we measure the
    latency of individual backbone links with average error under a
    millisecond.",

  abstract =
   "This paper describes a graphical representation called a concurrency
    map. It provides a succinct representation of the potentially large
    collection of possible correct event-orderings for a set of concurrent
    processes. The normal problems of monitoring, debugging and analyzing
    performance of single-process programs are compounded for programs with
    concurrent processes. Although we can observe the behavior of each separate
    process, we do not know what is occurring concurrently in the various
    processes during successive moments as execution progresses. Furthermore,
    unknown timing delays among the processes may cause different program
    behavior when we rerun the program. The relative time-ordering of events in
    different concurrent processes is not, in general, fixed, and events that
    occurred in one order on one occasion on which the program performed
    correctly might occur in another order on another occasion, with equal
    correctness. We need to know both how the program behaved during execution
    and how that behavior might have differed under normal variations of
    concurrent execution. The concurrency map aids in solving these problems.",
