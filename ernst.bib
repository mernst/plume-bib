   "This thesis is a pedagogical exposition of adequacy for recursive program
    schemes in the monotone frame.
    Adequacy relates the operational and denotational meanings of a term; it
    states that for any term of base type, the operational and denotational
    meanings are identical.  Adequacy is typically proved in the continuous
    frame.  This is a pedagogically questionable step; in order to prove
    adequacy (or some other property) of a pair of semantics, it would be
    desirable to show the property directly, without introducing superfluous
    notions.  This difficulty is particularly acute because, in general, not
    all monotone functions are continuous.
    \par
    This thesis attempts to work out the concept of adequacy for a class of
    monotone first-order recursive program schemes, using Vuillemin and Manna's
    method of ``safe'' computation rules.  The attempt is very nearly
    successful, but at a crucial point the fact that the scheme-definable
    functions are, in fact, continuous as well as monotone must be used.",

    The future of the software industry is today being shaped in the

    in the software industry and that the crucial question is not what the
    current law is, but rather what it ought to be. The fundamental issue
    is what shape and character of the industry would be best for all
    concerned. After addressing that we can consider what laws would bring
    this about.
    \par
    To begin addressing this question, the MIT Artificial Intelligence
    Laboratory, the Laboratory for Computer Science, and the Center for
    Coordination Science are hosting a panel discussion on October
    30th. Panelists from industry will speak from their extensive
    experience, offering a variety of perspectives on what forms of
    protection would best serve both the software industry and society in
    general:
    \par
    John Warnock (CEO and co-founder of Adobe Systems) has faced
    interesting and difficult decisions regarding what to keep proprietary
    and what to place in the public domain, in an attempt to balance the
    strategies of licensing proprietary technology and of providing open
    specifications that become widely used.
    \par
    Frank Ingari (Lotus Development Corp., currently in charge of the
    Emerging Markets Business Group) had first-hand experience with a
    variety of intellectual property protection questions surrounding 1-2-3
    while head of Lotus' PC Spreadsheet Division.
    \par
    Mitchell Kapor (Chairman, CEO and founder of On Technology, founder of
    Lotus Development Corp.) has extensive entrepreneurial experience in
    the software industry and has testified before Congress about
    appropriate protection for software.
    \par
    John Landry (Chairman, CEO, and co-founder of Agility Systems and
    previously Executive Vice President of Development at Cullinet
    Software) has been involved in the creation and development of numerous
    software companies and is the Chairman of the ADAPSO computer virus
    committee.
    \par
    Tom Lemberg (Chief Counsel, Lotus Development Corp.) is an expert on
    international law and international attitudes toward intellectual
    property; he will contribute a perspective on the ramifications for
    legal decisions and business practices in the US.
    \par
    Randall Davis (Moderator; Professor of Management, Professor of
    Computer Science, Associate Director of the MIT AI Lab), has served as
    panelist in a National Academy of Science workshop on Intellectual
    Property and Software, and as the court's expert witness in a software
    copyright infringement case.
    \par
    The panelists will make brief presentations, and ample time will be
    provided for audience participation. Some additional questions to be
    considered include:
    \par How should we balance the interests of established companies, start-ups, and users?
    \par How can we motivate innovation and iterative improvement, yet protect investment in
    software?
    \par Where is the value in software?
    \par What should be the bounds on intellectual property? Can (and should) an interface
    or language be owned?
    \par
    The panel will offer information on all sides of this complex issue and
    encourage the software community to consider the consequences of
    various approaches. The discussion is intended to initiate thought
    about what kind of industry makes sense for software and how the legal
    system can be used to achieve it.",

based on a form of common subexpression elimination across loop boundaries.",

"Programs often exhibit more parallelism than is actually available in the
target architecture.  This thesis introduces and evaluates three
methods---{\em loop unrolling}, {\em loop common expression elimination},
and {\em loop differencing}---for automatically transforming a parallel
algorithm into a partially serial one that takes advantage of only the
parallelism available at run time.  The resulting program performs less
computation to produce its results; the running time is not just improved
via second-order effects such as improving use of the memory hierarchy or
reducing overhead (these optimizations can further improve performance,
however).  The asymptotic complexity is not usually reduced, but the
constant factors can be lowered significantly, often by a factor of 4 or
more.  The basis for these methods is the detection of {\em loop common
expressions}, or common subexpressions in different iterations of a
parallel loop.  The loop differencing method also permits computation of
just the change in an expression from iteration to iteration.
\par
We define the class of {\em generalized stencil computations}, in which
loop common expressions can be easily found; each result combines $w$
operands, so a naive implementation requires $w$ operand evaluations and
$w-1$ combining operations per result.  Unrolling and application of our
common subexpression elimination algorithm can reduce its cost to less
than 2 operand evaluations and 3 combining operations per result.  Loop
common expression elimination decreases these costs to 1 and $\log w$,
respectively; when combined with unrolling they drop to 1
operand evaluation and 4 combining operations per result.  Loop
differencing reduces the per-result costs to 2 operand evaluations and 2
combining operations.  We discuss the tradeoffs among these techniques and
when each should be applied.
\par
We can achieve such speedups because, while the maximally parallel
implementation of an algorithm achieves the greatest speedup on a parallel
machine with sufficiently many processors, it may be inefficient when run
on a machine with too few processors.  Serial implementations run faster on
single-processor computers but often contain dependences which prevent
parallelization.  Our methods combine the efficiency of good serial
algorithms with the ease of writing, reading, debugging, and detecting
parallelism in high-level programs.
\par
Our three methods are primarily applicable to MIMD and SIMD implementations
of data-parallel languages when the data set size is larger than the number
of processors (including uniprocessor implementations), but they can also
improve the performance of parallel programs without serializing them.  The
methods may be applied as an optimization of a parallelizing compiler after
a serial program's parallelism has been exposed, and they are also
applicable to some serial programs.",

Dots-and-Boxes.  This paper first describes the game of Konane and the

    assigned to variables.  The slicer accounts for function calls,
    pointers, and aggregate structures.  It takes advantage of compiler
    analyses and transformations, resulting in more precise slices, and
    bypasses syntactic constraints by directly constructing executable
    slices.  These techniques are implemented in a slicer for the C
    programming language that accepts input via mouse clicks; operates on
    the value dependence graph, a dataflow-like program representation that
    is especially well-suited to slicing; and displays closure slices by

   "Programs often exhibit more parallelism than is actually available in
    the target architecture.  This thesis introduces and evaluates three
    methods --- {\em loop unrolling}, {\em loop common expression
    elimination}, and {\em loop differencing} --- for automatically
    transforming a parallel algorithm into a less parallel one that takes
    advantage of only the parallelism available at run time.  The resulting
    program performs less computation to produce its results; the running
    time is not just improved via second-order effects such as improving
    use of the memory hierarchy or reducing overhead (such optimizations
    can further improve performance).  The asymptotic complexity is not
    usually reduced, but the constant factors can be lowered significantly,
    often by a factor of 4 or more.  The basis for these methods is the
    detection of loop common expressions, or common subexpressions in
    different iterations of a parallel loop.  The loop differencing method
    also permits computation of just the change in an expression from
    iteration to iteration.
    \par
      We define the class of {\em generalized stencil computations}, in which loop
    common expressions can be easily found; each result combines w operands,
    so a naive implementation requires w operand evaluations and w-1
    combining operations per result.  Unrolling and application of the
    two-phase common subexpression elimination algorithm, which we introduce
    and which significantly outperforms other common subexpression elimination
    algorithms, can reduce its cost to less than 2 operand evaluations and 3
    combining operations per result.  Loop common expression elimination
    decreases these costs to 1 and log w, respectively; when combined with
    unrolling they drop to 1 operand evaluation and 4 combining operations per
    result.  Loop differencing reduces the per-result costs to 2 operand
    evaluations and 2 combining operations.  We discuss the tradeoffs among
    these techniques and when each should be applied.
    \par
      We can achieve such speedups because, while the maximally parallel
    implementation of an algorithm achieves the greatest speedup on a parallel
    machine with sufficiently many processors, it may be inefficient when run
    on a machine with too few processors.  Serial implementations, on the other
    hand, run faster on single-processor computers but often contain
    dependences which prevent parallelization.  Our methods combine the
    efficiency of good serial algorithms with the ease of writing, reading,
    debugging, and detecting parallelism in high-level programs.
    \par
      Our three methods are primarily applicable to MIMD and SIMD implementations
    of data-parallel languages when the data set size is larger than the number
    of processors (including uniprocessor implementations), but they can also
    improve the performance of parallel programs without serializing them.  The
    methods may be applied as an optimization of a parallelizing compiler after
    a serial program's parallelism has been exposed, and they are also
    applicable to some purely serial programs which manipulate arrays or other
    structured data.
    \par
      The techniques have been implemented, and preliminary timing results are
    reported.  Real-world computations are used as examples throughout, and an
    appendix lists more potential applications.",

    Invariants are valuable in many aspects of program development, including

    They also enhance programmers' understanding of data structures,

    are usually absent from programs, depriving programmers and automated
    tools of their benefits.
    \par
    This dissertation shows how invariants can be dynamically detected from
    program traces that capture variable values at program points of
    interest.  The user runs the target program over a test suite to create
    the traces, and an invariant detector determines which properties and
    relationships hold over both explicit variables and other expressions.
    Properties that hold over the traces and also satisfy other tests, such
    as being statistically justified, not being over unrelated variables, and
    not being implied by other reported invariants, are reported as likely
    invariants.  Like other dynamic techniques such as testing, the quality
    of the output depends in part on the comprehensiveness of the test suite.
    If the test suite is inadequate, then the output indicates how,
    permitting its improvement.  Dynamic analysis complements static
    techniques, which can be made sound but for which certain program
    constructs remain beyond the state of the art.

   "This paper shows how to integrate two complementary techniques for
    manipulating program invariants: dynamic detection and static verification.
    Dynamic detection proposes likely invariants based on program
    executions, but the resulting properties are not guaranteed to be true over
    all possible executions.  Static verification checks that properties are
    always true, but it can be difficult and tedious to
    select a goal and to annotate programs for input to a static checker.
    Combining these techniques overcomes the weaknesses of each: dynamically
    detected invariants can annotate a program or provide goals for static
    verification, and static verification can confirm properties proposed by a
    dynamic tool.
    \par
    We have integrated a tool for dynamically detecting likely program
    invariants, Daikon, with a tool for statically verifying program
    properties, ESC/Java.  Daikon examines run-time values of program
    variables; it looks for patterns and relationships in those values, and it
    reports properties that are never falsified during test runs and that
    satisfy certain other conditions, such as being statistically justified.
    ESC/Java takes as input a Java program annotated with preconditions,
    postconditions, and other assertions, and it reports which annotations
    cannot be statically verified and also warns of potential runtime errors,
    such as null dereferences and out-of-bounds array indices.
    \par
    Our prototype system runs Daikon, inserts its output into code as ESC/Java
    annotations, and then runs ESC/Java, which reports unverifiable
    annotations.  The entire process is completely automatic, though users may
    provide guidance in order to improve results if desired.  In preliminary

    Daikon.",

    analyzes 26 packages comprising 1.4 million lines of
    publicly available C code.  We determine the incidence of C preprocessor
    usage\,---\,whether in macro definitions, macro uses, or dependences upon
    macros\,---\,that is complex, potentially problematic, or inexpressible
    in terms of other C or C++ language features.  We taxonomize these
    various aspects of preprocessor use and particularly note data that are
    material to the development of tools for C or C++, including translating
    from C to C++ to reduce preprocessor usage.  Our results show that while
    most Cpp usage follows fairly simple patterns, an effective program
    analysis tool must address the preprocessor.
    \par
    The intimate connection between the C programming language and Cpp, and
    Cpp's unstructured transformations of token streams, often hinder
    programmer understanding of C programs and tools built to engineer C
    programs, such as compilers, debuggers, call graph extractors, and
    translators.  Most tools make no attempt to analyze macro usage, but
    simply preprocess their input, which results in a number of negative
    consequences; an analysis that takes Cpp into account is preferable, but
    building such tools requires an understanding of actual usage.
    Differences between the semantics of Cpp and those of C can lead to
    subtle bugs stemming from the use of the preprocessor, but there are no
    previous reports of the prevalence of such errors.  Use of C++ can reduce
    some preprocessor usage, but such usage has not been previously measured.
    Our data and analyses shed light on these issues and others related to

   "This thesis presents a new, automatic technique to assess whether
    replacing a component of a software system by a purportedly compatible
    component may change the behavior of the system.
    The technique operates before integrating the new component into the
    system or running system tests, permitting quicker and cheaper
    identification of problems.
    It takes into account the system's use of the component, because a
    particular component upgrade may be desirable in one context but
    undesirable in another.
    No formal specifications are required, permitting detection of
    problems due either to errors in the component or to errors in the
    system.
    Both external and internal behaviors can be compared, enabling
    detection of problems that are not immediately reflected in the
    output.
    \par
    The technique generates an operational abstraction for the old
    component in the context of the system, and one for the new component
    in the context of its test suite.
    An operational abstraction is a set of program properties that
    generalizes over observed run-time behavior.
    Modeling a system as divided into modules, and taking into account the
    control and data flow between the modules, we formulate a logical
    condition to guarantee that the system's behavior is preserved across
    a component replacement.
    If automated logical comparison indicates that the new component does
    not make all the guarantees that the old one did, then the upgrade may
    affect system behavior and should not be performed without further
    scrutiny.
    \par
    We describe a practical implementation of the technique, incorporating
    enhancements to handle non-local state, non-determinism, and missing
    test suites, and to distinguish old from new incompatibilities.
    We evaluate the implementation in case studies using real-world
    systems, including the Linux C library and 48 Unix programs.
    Our implementation identified real incompatibilities among versions of
    the C library that affected some of the programs, and it approved the
    upgrades for other programs that were unaffected by the changes.",

    formal verification to use component abstractions that can be automatically

    the replacement or integrating the new component into a system, whether the
    upgrade might be problematic for that particular system.  The technique is
    based on a rich model of components that support internal state, callbacks,
    and simultaneous upgrades of multiple components, and component
    abstractions may contain arbitrary logical properties including
    unbounded-state ones.

   "This paper describes a technique that selects, from a large set of test
    inputs, a small subset likely to reveal faults in the software under test.
    The technique takes a program or software component, plus a set of correct
    executions---say, from observations of the software running properly, or
    from an existing test suite that a user wishes to enhance.  The technique
    first infers an operational model of the software's operation.  Then,
    inputs whose operational pattern of execution differs from the model in
    specific ways are suggestive of faults.  These inputs are further reduced
    by selecting only one input per operational pattern. The result is a small
    portion of the original inputs, deemed by the technique as most likely to
    reveal faults.  Thus, the technique can also be seen as an error-detection
    technique.
    \par
    The paper describes two additional techniques that complement test input
    selection.  One is a technique for automatically producing an oracle (a set
    of assertions) for a test input from the operational model, thus
    transforming the test input into a test case.  The other is a
    classification-guided test input generation technique that also makes use
    of operational models and patterns.  When generating inputs, it filters out
    code sequences that are unlikely to contribute to legal inputs, improving
    the efficiency of its search for fault-revealing inputs.
    \par
    We have implemented these techniques in the Eclat tool, which generates
    unit tests for Java classes. Eclat's input is a set of classes to test and
    an example program execution---say, a passing test suite. Eclat's output is
    a set of JUnit test cases, each containing a potentially fault-revealing
    input and a set of assertions at least one of which fails.  In our
    experiments, Eclat successfully generated inputs that exposed
    fault-revealing behavior; we have used Eclat to reveal real errors in

    it is crucial to verify the legacy programs that make up our existing

    performing verification tasks and --- equally importantly --- in shifting
    their mindset to one of program verification.  I propose approaches to

    a machine learning technique that produces, from an existing program, a

  abstract =
   "The software engineering community increasingly recognizes the importance
    and value of dynamic analysis for program understanding.  A dynamic
    analysis runs a program and observes its execution.  Dynamic analysis for
    program understanding produces output, or feeds into a subsequent analysis,
    that enables programming tasks or increases human understanding of the
    code; this transcends traditional dynamic analysis for testing or
    optimization.
    \par
    Dynamic analysis complements traditional static analyses, such as compilers
    and type checkers, that have similar goals.  Once largely ignored by the
    research community due to unsoundness, of late there has been a flowering
    of research in this area.  Often, a dynamic analysis is more precise and
    can better handle incomplete programs, programs written in multiple
    languages, and analysis of program environments, among other situations.
    \par
    This tutorial will explore the active new area of program analysis for
    program understanding and software engineering.  It will cover theoretical
    background, implementation techniques, and applications, with particular
    focus on applications to practical programming tasks and on developing new
    applications.  It will also present tools that you can use or build on in
    your practice or research, with the opportunity for hands-on experience, if
    there is interest.
    \par
    The tutorial format will encourage questions, discussion, and interaction,
    in order to enable participants to get the most out of it."

   "Corrupt data structures are an important cause of unacceptable program
    execution. Data structure repair (which eliminates inconsistencies by
    updating corrupt data structures to conform to consistency
    constraints) promises to enable many programs to continue to execute
    acceptably in the face of otherwise fatal data structure corruption
    errors. A key issue is obtaining an accurate and comprehensive data
    structure consistency specification.
    \par
    We present a new technique for obtaining data structure consistency
    specifications for data structure repair. Instead of requiring the
    developer to manually generate such specifications, our approach
    automatically generates candidate data structure consistency
    properties using the Daikon invariant detection tool.  The developer
    then reviews these properties, potentially rejecting or generalizing
    overly specific properties to obtain a specification suitable for
    automatic enforcement via data structure repair.
    \par
    We have implemented this approach and applied it to three sizable
    benchmark programs: CTAS (an air-traffic control system), BIND (a
    widely-used Internet name server) and Freeciv (an interactive game).
    Our results indicate that (1) automatic constraint generation produces
    constraints that enable programs to execute successfully through data
    structure consistency errors, (2) compared to manual specification,
    automatic generation can produce more comprehensive sets of
    constraints that cover a larger range of data structure consistency
    properties, and (3) reviewing the properties is relatively
    straightforward and requires substantially less programmer effort than
    manual generation, primarily because it reduces the need to examine
    the program text to understand its operation and extract the relevant
    consistency constraints.  Moreover, when evaluated by a hostile third
    party ``Red Team'' contracted to evaluate the effectiveness of the

    and criteria for evaluating them.  It also gives students practice in

   "Type safety and expressiveness of many existing Java libraries and their

    generic classes.  Efficient and accurate tools exist to assist client
    applications to use generic libraries, but so far the libraries themselves
    must be parameterized manually, which is a tedious, time-consuming, and
    error-prone task.  We present a type-constraint-based algorithm for
    converting non-generic libraries to add type parameters.  The algorithm
    handles the full Java language and preserves backward compatibility, thus
    making it safe for existing clients.  Among other features, it is capable
    of inferring wildcard types and introducing type parameters for
    mutually-dependent classes.  We have implemented the algorithm as a fully
    automatic refactoring in Eclipse.
    \par
    We evaluated our work in two ways.  First, our tool parameterized code that
    was lacking type parameters.  We contacted the developers of several of
    these applications, and in all cases they
    confirmed that the resulting parameterizations were correct and useful.
    Second, to better quantify its effectiveness, our tool parameterized
    classes from already-generic libraries, and we compared the results to
    those that were created by the libraries' authors.  Our tool performed the
    refactoring accurately---in 87\% of cases the results were as good as those

    incorporating feedback obtained from executing test inputs as they are

    method call to apply and finding arguments from among
    previously-constructed inputs. As soon as an input is built, it is executed
    and checked against a set of contracts and filters. The result of the
    execution determines whether the input is redundant, illegal,
    contract-violating, or useful for generating more inputs. The technique
    outputs a test suite consisting of unit tests for the classes under
    test. Passing tests can be used to ensure that code contracts are preserved
    across program changes; failing tests (that violate one or more contract)
    point to potential errors that should be corrected.
    \par
    Our experimental results indicate that feedback-directed random test
    generation can outperform systematic and undirected random test generation,
    in terms of coverage and error detection. On four small but nontrivial data
    structures (used previously in the literature), our technique achieves
    higher or equal block and predicate coverage than model checking (with and

    that is, the Daikon invariant detector reports likely program

    documentation, and formal specifications.   Examples
    include being constant ($x = a$), non-zero ($x \ne 0$), being
    in a range ($a \le x \le b$), linear relationships ($y =

    Dynamic invariant detection runs a program, observes the values
    that the program computes, and then reports properties that were
    true over the observed executions.  Dynamic invariant detection is
    a machine learning technique that can be applied to arbitrary

    While case studies have demonstrated the practicality and value of

  abstract =
   "A static type system helps programmers to detect and prevent errors.
    However, a language's built-in type system does not help to detect and
    prevent enough errors, because it cannot express certain important
    invariants.  A user-defined, or pluggable, type system enriches a
    language's built-in type system via type qualifiers.  Pluggable types
    permit more expressive compile-time checking, and they can guarantee
    the absence of additional errors.  Example type qualifiers include
    nonnull, readonly, interned, and tainted.
    \par
    Despite considerable interest in user-defined type qualifiers,
    previous frameworks have been too inexpressive, unscalable, or
    incompatible with existing languages or tools.  This has hindered the
    evaluation, understanding, and uptake of pluggable types.
    \par
    The Checker Framework supports adding pluggable type systems to the
    Java language in a backward-compatible way.  The Checker Framework is
    useful to two constituencies.  A type system designer can create a
    type-checker for a custom type system.  A programmer can use the
    type-checker to detect errors or verify their absence.
    \par
    The Checker Framework is expressive and flexible.  It builds in many
    features needed by type system designers and programmers, including:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item backward-compatible Java and classfile syntax for type qualifiers
    \item integration with javac and Eclipse
    \item three type inference tools to ease programmer annotation burden
    \item declarative and procedural syntax for writing type-checking rules
    \item flow-sensitive type qualifier inference
    \item polymorphism over types (Java generics)
    \item polymorphism over type qualifiers
    \item implicit and default qualifiers
    \end{itemize}
    \par
    Experience indicates that the Checker Framework is useful to
    programmers and type system designers.  For programmers, type-checkers
    built using the Checker Framework have processed over 600K lines of
    code, finding real errors in every program.  For type system
    designers, the checkers are concise, even for robust implementations
    of sophisticated type systems, and the simplest type systems require
    writing no code at all.  The Checker Framework is being used by
    researchers around the world to perform realistic evaluation of type
    systems.  It has yielded new insight into existing type systems and
    has enabled the creation and evaluation of new ones.
    \par
    This demonstration will illustrate the power of the Checker Framework,
    both for programmers and for type system designers, and will prepare
    you to begin using it yourself.

    A type system designer defines type qualifiers and their semantics, and a

    qualifiers in their programs and use the plug-in to detect or prevent

    write error-free code, and to type system designers who wish to evaluate
    and deploy their type systems.

    The Checker Framework includes new Java syntax for expressing type
    qualifiers; declarative and procedural mechanisms for writing
    type-checking rules; and support for flow-sensitive local type qualifier
    inference and for polymorphism over types and qualifiers.  The Checker
    Framework is well-integrated with the Java language and toolset.

   "Source code analysis is a prerequisite to source code manipulation.  An
    understanding of what the code does --- that is, a model of its behavior --- is
    needed in order to propose or to verify a transformation, to enable
    subsequent analyses, and for other purposes.  The research community is
    justifiably proud of its many successful analysis techniques and
    applications.
    \par
    However, in some cases an analysis can hinder source code manipulation.
    Simple examples are a type system, style checker, or analysis that forbids,
    or cannot handle, certain code idioms.  Every programmer is familiar with
    adjusting coding style to the limitations of a language, framework, build
    system, etc.  Similar limitations apply to automated program manipulation.
    \par
    Related problems arise when analyzing legacy code.  A programmer may have
    chosen among multiple designs with similar qualities.  Later, when an
    analysis reveals a reason that one of them was preferable, the cost of
    reworking the program may be prohibitive, particularly if the
    transformation is not justified on correctness grounds.
    \par
    I will explore these and related problems in the context of type inference,
    type checking, and testing --- drawing connections and highlighting
    differences among them.  I will illustrate both the strengths of these
    activities and also some ways that they are less useful than they could be.
    I will suggest lifting some of their strictures, either temporarily and
    permanently, in an effort to give programmers the best of all worlds.",

    ClearView (1) observes normal executions to learn invariants that
    characterize the application's normal behavior, (2) uses error
    detectors to monitor the execution to detect failures, (3)
    identifies violations of learned invariants that occur during failed
    executions, (4) generates candidate repair patches that enforce
    selected invariants by changing the state or the flow of control to
    make the invariant true, and (5) observes the continued execution of
    patched applications to select the most successful patch.

    ClearView is designed to correct errors in software with high
    availability requirements. Aspects of ClearView that make it
    particularly appropriate for this context include its ability to
    generate patches without human intervention, to apply and remove
    patches in running applications without requiring restarts
    or otherwise perturbing the execution, and to identify and discard
    ineffective or damaging patches by evaluating the continued behavior
    of patched applications.

    In a Red Team exercise, ClearView survived attacks that exploit security
    vulnerabilities. A hostile external Red Team developed ten code-injection
    exploits and used these exploits to repeatedly attack an application

    attacks.  For seven of the ten exploits, ClearView automatically
    generated patches that corrected the error, enabling the application to
    survive the attacks and successfully process subsequent inputs.  The Red

    representation exposure or violation of immutability contracts.  This paper
    presents \emph{Ownership Immutability Generic Java} (OIGJ), a
    backward-compatible purely-static language extension supporting ownership
    and immutability.  We formally defined a core calculus for OIGJ, based on
    Featherweight Java, and proved it sound.  We also implemented OIGJ and

    Creation of immutable cyclic structures requires a ``\emph{cooking phase}''

    OIGJ is easy for a programmer to use, and it is easy to implement

    more expressive than previous ownership languages, in the sense that it can
    type-check more good code.  OIGJ can express the factory and visitor
    patterns, and OIGJ can type-check Sun's \texttt{java.util} collections

    small number of annotations.  Previous work required major refactoring of

    industrial product line, about 4\% of the bugs are duplicated across more
    than one product or file.  In three open source projects (the Linux kernel,
    the Git version control system, and the PostgreSQL database) we found 282,
    33, and 33 duplicated bugs, respectively.  Second, this paper presents a
    tool, CBCD, that searches for code that is semantically identical to given
    buggy code.  CBCD tests graph isomorphism over the Program Dependency Graph
    (PDG) representation and uses four optimizations.  We evaluated CBCD by
    searching for known clones of buggy code segments in the three projects and
    compared the results with text-based, token-based, and AST-based code clone
    detectors, namely Simian, CCFinder, and CloneDr.  The results of the
    evaluation show that CBCD is applicable for its principal use: it is fast
    when searching for possible clones of the buggy code in a large system and
    it is more precise than the other code clone detectors.",

   "In an object-oriented program, a unit test often consists of a sequence of

    a method under test.  It is challenging to automatically generate sequences
    that are \textit{legal} and \textit{behaviorally-diverse}, that is,
    reaching as many different program states as possible.
    \par
    This paper proposes a combined static and dynamic automated test generation
    approach to address these problems, for code without a formal
    specification. Our approach first uses dynamic analysis to infer a call
    sequence model from a sample execution, then uses static analysis to
    identify method dependence relations based on the fields they may read or

   "Many automatic testing, analysis, and verification techniques for programs
    can effectively be reduced to a constraint-generation phase followed by a
    constraint-solving phase. This separation of concerns often leads to more
    effective and maintainable software reliability tools. The increasing
    efficiency of offthe-shelf constraint solvers makes this approach even more
    compelling. However, there are few effective and sufficiently expressive
    off-the-shelf solvers for string constraints generated by analysis of
    string-manipulating programs, and hence researchers end up implementing
    their own ad-hoc solvers. Thus, there is a clear need for an effective and
    expressive string-constraint solver that can be easily integrated into a
    variety of applications.
    \par
    To fulfill this need, we designed and implemented Hampi, an efficient and
    easy-to-use string solver. Users of the Hampi string solver specify
    constraints using membership predicate over regular expressions,
    context-free grammars, and equality/dis-equality between string
    terms. These terms are constructed out of string constants, bounded string
    variables, and typical string operations such as concatenation and
    substring extraction. Hampi takes such a constraint as input and decides
    whether it is satisfiable or not. If an input constraint is satisfiable,
    Hampi generates a satsfying assignment for the string variables that occur
    in it.

    \par
    This paper presents \emph{Synoptic}, a tool that helps developers by
    inferring a concise and accurate system model. Unlike most related
    work, Synoptic does not require developer-written scenarios,
    specifications, negative execution examples, or other complex user
    input. Synoptic processes the logs most systems already produce and
    requires developers only to specify a set of regular expressions for
    parsing the logs.

    Synoptic has two unique features.  First, the model it produces
    satisfies temporal invariants mined from the logs, improving
    accuracy over related approaches.  Second, Synoptic uses refinement
    and coarsening to explore the model space.  This improves model
    efficiency and precision, compared to using just one approach.

   "We present a technique --- lock capabilities --- for statically verifying
    that multithreaded programs with locks will not deadlock.  Most previous
    work is built around a strict total order on all locks held simultaneously
    by a thread, but such an invariant often does not hold with fine-grained
    locking, especially when data-structure mutations change the order locks
    are acquired.  Lock capabilities support idioms that use fine-grained
    locking, such as mutable binary trees, circular lists, and arrays where
    each element has a different lock.
    \par
    Lock capabilities do not enforce a total order and do not prevent external
    references to data-structure nodes.  Instead, the technique reasons about
    static capabilities, where a thread already holding locks can attempt to
    acquire another lock only if its capabilities allow it.  Acquiring one lock
    may grant a capability to acquire further locks, and in data-structures
    where heap shape affects safe locking orders, we can use the heap structure
    to induce the capability-granting relation.  Deadlock-freedom follows from
    ensuring that the capability-granting relation is acyclic.  Where
    necessary, we restrict aliasing with a variant of unique references to
    allow strong updates to the capability-granting relation, while still

    Evaluation of tools and processes does not meet the standards that

    another.  Test-first development strategies help one project but cripple
    another.  Formal development methods (based on specification and
    verification) sometimes reduce costs but other times increase them, with
    varying correlation to quality.  Programmers sing the praises of improved
    productivity when adopting languages with strong type systems --- or
    languages without static typing.  There are also rifts between techniques
    that are shown effective in research laboratories and those that are
    adopted in practice:  research experiments are often not indicative of
    effectiveness in the field.  These discordant observations hold back our
    field by sowing confusion among researchers and doubt among practitioners,

   "The growing demand for large-scale data mining and data analysis
    applications has led both industry and academia to design new types of
    highly scalable data-intensive computing platforms. MapReduce has enjoyed
    particular success. However, MapReduce lacks built-in support for iterative
    programs, which arise naturally in many applications including data mining,
    web ranking, graph analysis, and model fitting. This paper (This is an
    extended version of the VLDB 2010 paper ``HaLoop: Efficient Iterative Data
    Processing on Large Clusters'' PVLDB 3(1):285--296, 2010.) presents HaLoop, a
    modified version of the Hadoop MapReduce framework, that is designed to
    serve these applications. HaLoop allows iterative applications to be
    assembled from existing Hadoop programs without modification, and
    significantly improves their efficiency by providing inter-iteration
    caching mechanisms and a loop-aware scheduler to exploit these
    caches. HaLoop retains the fault-tolerance properties of MapReduce through
    automatic cache recovery and task re-execution. We evaluated HaLoop on a
    variety of real applications and real datasets. Compared with Hadoop, on
    average, HaLoop improved runtimes by a factor of 1.85 and shuffled only 4\%
    as much data between mappers and reducers in the applications that we
    tested.",

  abstract =
   "To keep a Graphical User Interface (GUI) responsive and active, a GUI
    application often has a main \textit{UI thread} (or \textit{event
    dispatching thread}) and spawns separate threads to handle lengthy
    operations in the background, such as expensive computation, I/O tasks, and
    network requests.  Many GUI frameworks require all GUI objects to be
    accessed exclusively by the UI thread. If a GUI object is accessed from a
    non-UI thread, an \textit{invalid thread access} error occurs and the whole
    application may abort.
    \par
    This paper presents a general technique to find such \textit{invalid thread
    access} errors in multithreaded GUI applications. We formulate finding
    invalid thread access errors as a call graph reachability problem with
    thread spawning as the sources and GUI object accessing as the sinks.
    Standard call graph construction algorithms fail to build a good call graph
    for some modern GUI applications, because of heavy use of reflection.
    Thus, our technique builds reflection-aware call graphs.
    \par
    We implemented our technique and instantiated it for four popular Java GUI
    frameworks: SWT, the Eclipse plugin framework, Swing, and Android. In an

   "Formally verifying a program requires significant skill not only because of

    verification economically unattractive by preventing the use of
    less-skilled (less-expensive) workers and distributed workflows (i.e.,

    This paper presents VeriWeb, a web-based IDE for verification that

    several innovative user interface features: drag and drop condition
    construction, concrete counterexamples, and specification inlining.

    To evaluate VeriWeb, we performed three experiments.  First, we show that
    VeriWeb lowers the time and monetary cost of verification by performing a
    comparative study of VeriWeb and a traditional tool using 14 paid subjects
    contracted hourly from Exhedra Solution's vWorker online marketplace.
    Second, we demonstrate the dearth and insufficiency of current ad-hoc labor
    marketplaces for verification by recruiting workers from Amazon's

   "Many automatic testing, analysis, and verification techniques for programs
    can be effectively reduced to a constraint-generation phase followed by a
    constraint-solving phase. This separation of concerns often leads to more
    effective and maintainable software reliability tools. The increasing
    efficiency of off-the-shelf constraint solvers makes this approach even
    more compelling. However, there are few effective and sufficiently
    expressive off-the-shelf solvers for string constraints generated by
    analysis of string-manipulating programs, so researchers end up
    implementing their own ad-hoc solvers.
    \par
    To fulfill this need, we designed and implemented Hampi, a solver for
    string constraints over bounded string variables. Users of Hampi specify
    constraints using regular expressions, context-free grammars, equality
    between string terms, and typical string operations such as concatenation
    and substring extraction. Hampi then finds a string that satisfies all the
    constraints or reports that the constraints are unsatisfiable.
    \par
    We demonstrate Hampi's expressiveness and efficiency by applying it to
    program analysis and automated testing. We used Hampi in static and dynamic
    analyses for finding SQL injection vulnerabilities in Web applications with
    hundreds of thousands of lines of code. We also used Hampi in the context
    of automated bug finding in C programs using dynamic systematic testing
    (also known as concolic testing). We then compared Hampi with another

    imperative programs.  Unrestricted side effects through one reference can

    approach to reasoning about safe assumptions in the presence of aliasing
    and side effects, unifying ideas from reference immutability type systems
    and rely-guarantee program logics.  Our approach, \emph{rely-guarantee
    references}, treats multiple references to shared objects similarly to
    multiple threads in rely-guarantee program logics.  We propose statically
    associating rely and guarantee conditions with individual references to
    shared objects.  Multiple aliases to a given object may coexist only if the
    guarantee condition of each alias implies the rely condition for all other
    aliases.  We demonstrate that existing reference immutability type systems
    are special cases of rely-guarantee references.

    In addition to allowing precise control over state modification,
    rely-guarantee references allow types to depend on mutable data while still
    permitting flexible aliasing.  Dependent types whose denotation is stable
    over the actions of the rely and guarantee conditions for a reference and
    its data will not be invalidated by any action through any alias.  We

    data.  As a special case, we derive the first reference immutability type
    system with dependent types over immutable data.

   "It is beneficial for a developer to know whether a code change affects the

    analysis.  This interrupts the developer's workflow and/or lengthens the
    delay between the time when the developer makes a change and when the
    developer learns its effects and implications. The situation is even worse
    for an impure analysis --- one that modifies the code on which it runs ---
    because such an analysis blocks the developer from working on the code.

    This paper presents a novel approach to easily converting an offline
    analysis --- even an impure one --- into a continuous analysis that informs
    the developer of the implications of recent changes as quickly as possible
    after the change is made. Our approach copies the developer's codebase,
    incrementally keeps this codebase in sync with the developer's copy, and
    makes that copy available for offline analyses to run without disturbing
    the developer, and without the developer's changes disturbing the analyses.
    \par
    We have implemented our approach in Solstice, an open-source,
    publicly-available Eclipse plug-in for implementing continuous analyses.
    We used Solstice to convert three offline analyses --- FindBugs, PMD, and
    unit testing --- into continuous ones. Each conversion required only 700
    LoC (600 LoC NCSL) and took, on aver- age, 18 hours by a single developer

    under 3 milliseconds in runtime overhead per developer action, which is

   "In a test suite, all the test cases should be independent:  no test should
    affect any other test's result, and running the tests in any order should
    produce the same test results.  Test independence is important so that
    tests behave consistently as intended by the developers.  In addition,
    techniques such as test prioritization assume that the tests in a suite are
    independent, but they do not justify that assumption.  Test dependence is a
    little-studied phenomenon.  This paper presents five results related to
    test dependence.
    \par
    First, we characterize the test dependence that arises in practice.  We
    studied 96 real-world dependent tests from 5 issue tracking systems.  Our
    study shows that test dependence can be hard for programmers to identify.
    It also shows that test dependence can cause non-trivial consequences, such
    as masking program faults and leading to spurious bug reports.
    \par
    Second, we formally define test dependence in terms of test suites as
    ordered sequences of tests along with explicit environments in which these
    tests are executed.  We formulate the problem of detecting dependent tests
    and prove that a useful special case is NP-complete.
    \par
    Third, guided by the study of real-world dependent tests, we propose and
    compare three algorithms to detect dependent tests in a test suite.
    \par
    Fourth, we applied our dependent test detection algorithms to 4 real-world
    programs and found dependent tests in each human-written and
    automatically-generated test suite.
    \par
    Fifth, we empirically assessed the impact of dependent tests on five test
    prioritization techniques and found that dependent tests affect the output
    of \textit{all} five techniques.",

    faults, testing research often uses mutants, which are artificial faults
    --- each one a simple syntactic variation --- that are systematically

    because large numbers of mutants can be automatically generated and used as
    a proxy for real faults.

    Unfortunately, there is little experimental evidence to support the use of
    mutants as a proxy for real faults. This paper investigates whether mutants

    suite's ability to detect mutants is correlated with its ability to detect
    real faults that developers have fixed.

    more than just a collection of ``nifty assignments'':  rather, it affects

    \par
    This paper addresses the following question during the evolution
    of a configurable software system: which configuration options
    should a user change to maintain the software's desired behavior?
    This paper presents a technique (and its tool implementation,
    called ConfSuggester) to troubleshoot configuration errors
    caused by software evolution.
    ConfSuggester uses dynamic profiling, execution trace
    comparison, and static analysis to link the undesired
    behavior to its root cause --- a configuration option
    whose value can be changed to produce desired behavior from the new
    software version.
    \par
    We evaluated ConfSuggester on 8 configuration errors
    from 6 configurable software systems written in Java.
    For 6 errors, the root-cause configuration option was
    ConfSuggester's first suggestion. For 1 error, the root cause
    was ConfSuggester's third suggestion. The root cause
    of the remaining error was ConfSuggester's sixth suggestion.

    \par
    This paper makes three research contributions based on an
    investigation of open-source projects' use of Code Contracts.
    First, we characterize Code Contract usage in practice.
    For example, approximately three-fourths of the Code Contracts
    are basic checks for the presence of data.  We discuss similarities and
    differences in usage across the projects, and we identify annotation burden,
    tool support, and training as possible explanations based on
    developer interviews.
    Second, based on contracts automatically inferred for four of the projects,
    we find that developers
    underutilize contracts for expressing state updates, object state
    indicators, and conditional properties.
    Third, we performed user studies to learn how developers decide which
    contracts to enforce.  The developers used contract suggestions to support
    their existing use cases with more expressive contracts.  However, the
    suggestions did not lead them to experiment with other use cases for
    which contracts are better-suited.

    In support of the research contributions, the paper presents two engineering
    contributions:

    ordered sequences of tests along with explicit environments in which these
    tests are executed.  We formulate the problem of detecting dependent tests

    scalability problems --- a test suite is executed for each of a large
    number of mutants.  Despite numerous optimizations presented in the
    literature, this scalability issue remains, and this is one of the reasons
    why mutation analysis is hardly used in practice.

    Whereas most previous optimizations attempted to statically reduce the
    number of executions or their computational overhead, this paper exploits
    information available only at run time to further reduce the number of
    executions.
    \par
    First, \emph{state infection conditions} can reveal --- with a single test
    execution of the unmutated program --- which mutants would lead to a
    different state, thus avoiding unnecessary test executions.
    Second, determining whether an infected execution state \emph{propagates}
    can further reduce the number of executions. Mutants that are embedded in
    compound expressions may infect the state locally without affecting the
    outcome of the compound expression.
    Third, those mutants that do infect the state can be \emph{partitioned}
    based on the resulting infected state --- if two mutants lead to the same
    infected state, only one needs to be executed as the result of the other
    can be inferred.

    In our model, the software vendor and the app store auditor collaborate ---
    each does tasks that are easy for her/him, reducing overall verification
    cost.  The software vendor provides a behavioral specification of
    information flow (at a finer granularity than used by current app stores)

    flow-sensitive, context-sensitive information-flow type system checks the

   "A good test suite is one that detects real faults.  Because the set of
    faults in a program is usually unknowable, this definition is not useful to
    practitioners who are creating test suites, nor to researchers who are
    creating and evaluating tools that generate test suites.  In place of real
    faults, testing research often uses mutants, which are artificial faults
    --- each one a simple syntactic variation --- that are systematically
    seeded throughout the program under test. Mutation analysis is appealing
    because large numbers of mutants can be automatically-generated and used to
    compensate for low quantities or the absence of known real faults.
    \par
    Unfortunately, there is little experimental evidence to support the use of
    mutants as a replacement for real faults.  This paper investigates whether
    mutants are indeed a valid substitute for real faults, i.e., whether a test
    suite's ability to detect mutants is correlated with its ability to detect
    real faults that developers have fixed.  Unlike prior studies, these
    investigations also explicitly consider the conflating effects of code
    coverage on the mutant detection rate.

    Our experiments used 357 real faults in 5 open-source applications that

   "In a test suite, all the test cases should be independent: no test should
    affect any other test's result, and running the tests in any order should
    produce the same test results. The assumption of test independence is
    important so that tests behave consistently as designed. In addition, many
    downstream testing techniques, including test prioritization, test
    selection, and test parallelization, assume test independence. However,
    this critical assumption often does not hold in practice.
    \par
    This paper empirically investigates the impact of test dependence on three
    downstream testing techniques (test prioritization, selection, and
    parallelization) and proposes a general approach to cope with such
    impact. It presents two sets of results.
    \par
    First, we describe an empirical study to assess the impact of test
    dependence on 4 test prioritization, 6 test selection, and 2 test
    parallelization algorithms. Test dependence negatively affects the results
    of all these downstream testing algorithms. For example, an
    automatically-generated test suite for the XML-Security program contains
    665 tests, and 111 of those tests yield a different test result (success
    vs. fail) if the suite is parallelized to run on 16 CPUs.
    \par
    Second, we present an approach that enhances each test prioritization,
    selection, and parallelization algorithm to respect test dependence, so
    that each test in a suite yields the same result before and after applying
    the downstream testing technique. In an experimental evaluation, the
    enhanced testing algorithms worked as intended: the test results were
    consistent even in the presence of test dependence, and they did not
    substantially compromise the effectiveness of the original testing
    algorithms.",

    "Formal techniques for guaranteeing software correctness have made

    However, applying these techniques to real-world safety-critical
    systems remains challenging in practice.
    Inspired by goals set out in prior work, we report on a large-scale case
    study that applies modern verification techniques to check safety
    properties of a radiotherapy system in current clinical use.
    Because of the diversity and complexity of the system's components (software,
    hardware, and physical), no single tool was suitable for both checking
    critical component properties and ensuring that their composition
    implies critical system properties.
    This paper describes how we used state-of-the-art approaches to develop
    specialized tools for verifying safety properties of individual components,
    as well as an extensible tool for composing those properties to check the
    safety of the system as a whole.
    We describe the key design decisions that diverged from previous approaches
    and that enabled us to practically apply our approach to provide
    machine-checked guarantees.

   "A fault localization technique takes as input a faulty program, and it
    produces as output a ranked list of suspicious code locations at which the

    localization technique, they evaluate it on programs with known faults;
    they score the technique based on where in its output list the defective
    code appears.  This enables comparison of multiple fault localization
    techniques to determine which one is better.
    \par
    Previous research has evaluated fault localization techniques using
    artificial faults, generated either by mutation tools or
    manually.  In other words, previous research has determined which fault

    is not known which fault localization techniques are best at finding real

    This paper presents SpaceSearch, a new library for developing solver-aided

    results provided by the interface are sufficient to establish the tool's

    an implementation in a solver-aided language (e.g., Rosette), where
    SpaceSearch provides an efficient instantiation of the SpaceSearch
    interface with calls to an underlying SMT solver. This combines the strong

    high performance of modern SMT solvers. This paper also introduces new

    checking industrial configurations spanning over 240 KLOC, identifying 19

   "When test cases are \emph{independent}, no test affects any other test's
    outcome, and running the tests in any order yields the same test
    outcomes. Many test-reordering techniques, including test prioritization,
    test selection, and test parallelization, assume test independence.
    However, this critical assumption often does not hold in practice, causing
    the test-reordering techniques to produce incorrect suites.
    \par
    This paper first describes an empirical study to assess the impact of test
    dependence on 4 test prioritization, 6 test selection, and 2 test
    parallelization algorithms. Test dependence negatively affects all these
    test-reordering algorithms: the test suites that they produce suffer false
    alarms and missed alarms, both of which are costly in terms of developer
    time or impact the reliability of the software.
    \par
    The paper then presents a new approach that modifies each test-reordering
    algorithm to maintain test dependence. One of its inputs is a set of test
    dependences, which was precomputed from a prior version of the
    software. After the original test prioritization, selection, or
    parallelization algorithm produces a suite, our approach further reorders
    and/or adds tests to the suite to maintain the order required by the test
    dependences. This reduces false positives and false negatives in the final
    test suite.
    \par
    In an experimental evaluation, dependence-aware test-reordering algorithms
    worked as intended: they quickly produced test suites whose outcomes were
    consistent with the original order, even when the original suite contained

   "Procedure specifications are useful in many software development tasks,
    such as test case generation, debugging, program comprehension, code
    synthesis, refactoring, formal verification, run-time monitoring. As one
    example, specifications are useful in automatic test case generation: they
    help a tool produce inputs that induce peculiar behaviors, and they act as
    test oracles able to reveal bugs.
    \par
    Whereas formal specifications are seldom available in practice, it is
    standard practice for developers to document their code with
    semi-structured comments such as Doxygen, Javadoc, RDoc, and Sphinx. These
    comments express the procedure specification with a mix of predefined tags
    and natural language.
    \par
    This paper presents Jdoctor, an approach that combines natural language
    parsing with pattern matching to translate Javadoc comments into executable
    procedure specifications written as Java expressions. In an empirical
    evaluation, Jdoctor achieved precision of 91\% and recall of 60\% in
    translating Javadoc into procedure specifications. This is substantially
    better than previous work; the respective f-measure scores are @tComment
    40\%, Toradocu 50\%, Jdoctor 72\%. We also supplied the Jdoctor-derived
    specifications to an automated test case generation tool, Randoop. The
    specifications enabled Randoop to generate test cases that reveal more
    defects, produce fewer false alarms, and achieve higher coverage.",
