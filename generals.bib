                 too expensive for nearly all applications. This thesis
                 investigates the possibilities of using specifications
                 too lightweight static checks to detect inconsistencies
                 between specifications and implementations. A tool,

                 code using LCL specifications. It is similar to
                 traditional lint, except it uses information in
                 specifications to do more powerful checks. Some typical
                 problems detected by LCLint include violations of

  abstract =     "This thesis presents three ideas. First, it presents a
                 novel use of formal specification to promote a
                 programming style based on specified interfaces and
                 data abstraction in a programming language that lacks
                 such supports. Second it illustrates the uses of claims
                 about specifications. Third, it describes a software
                 reengineering process for making existing software
                 easier to maintain and reuse. The process centers
                 around specifying existing software modules and using
                 the specifications to drive the code improvement
                 process. The Larch/C Interface Language, or LCL, is a
                 formal specification language for documenting ANSI C
                 software modules. Although C does not support abstract
                 types, LCL is designed to support abstract types. A
                 lint-like program, LCLint, enforces type discipline in
                 clients of LCL abstract types. LCL is structured in a
                 way that enables LCLint to extract information from an
                 LCL specification for performing some consistency
                 checks between the specification and its
                 implementation. LCL also provides facilities to state
                 claims, or redundant, problem-specific assertions about
                 a specification. Claims enhance the role of
                 specifications as a software documentation tool. Claims
                 can be used to highlight important or unusual
                 properties, promote design coherence of software
                 modules, and aid in program reasoning. In addition,
                 claims about a specification can be used to test the
                 specification by proving that they follow semantically
                 from the specification. A semantics of LCL suitable for
                 reasoning about claims is given. A software
                 reengineering process developed around LCL and claims
                 is effective for improving existing programs. The
                 impact of the process applied to an existing C program
                 is described. The process improved the modularity and
                 robustness of the program with changing its essential
                 functionality or performance. A major product of the
                 process is the specifications of the main modules of
                 the reengineered program. A proof checker was used to
                 verify some claims about the specifications; and in the
                 process, several specifications mistakes were found.
                 The specifications are also used to illustrate
                 specification writing techniques and heuristics",

                 semantics that do not permit side-effects. This lack of
                 side-effects makes automatic detection of parallelism
                 and optimization for data locality in programs much
                 easier. However, the same property poses a challenge in
                 implementing these languages efficiently. The authors
                 describe an optimizing compiler system that solves the
                 key problem of aggregate copy elimination. The methods
                 developed rely exclusively on compile-time algorithms,
                 including interprocedural analysis, that are applied to
                 an intermediate data flow representation. By dividing
                 the problem into update-in-place and build-in-place
                 analysis, a small set of relatively simple
                 techniques-edge substitution, graph pattern matching,
                 substructure sharing and substructure targeting-was
                 found to be very powerful. If combined properly and
                 implemented carefully, the algorithms eliminate
                 unnecessary copy operations to a very high degree. No
                 run-time overhead is imposed on the compiled
                 programs.",

                 checking technique that provides complete error
                 coverage through a simple set of program
                 transformations. Our technique, based on an extended
                 safe pointer representation, has a number of novel
                 aspects. Foremost, it is the first technique that
                 detects all spatial and temporal access errors. Its use
                 is not limited by the expressiveness of the language;
                 that is, it can be applied successfully to compiled or
                 interpreted languages with subscripted and mutable
                 pointers, local references, and explicit and typeless
                 dynamic storage management, e.g., C. Because it is a
                 source level transformation, it is amenable to both
                 compile- and run-time optimization. Finally, its
                 performance, even without compile-time optimization, is
                 quite good. We implemented a prototype translator for
                 the C language and analyzed the checking overheads of
                 six non-trivial, pointer intensive programs. Execution
                 overheads range from 130\% to 540\%; with text and data

                 limits garbage collection overhead to the time actually
                 required for garbage collection. In particular,
                 application programs that rarely or never make use of
                 the collector no longer encounter a substantial
                 performance penalty. This approach greatly simplifies
                 the implementation of languages supporting garbage
                 collection. It further allows conventional compilers to
                 be used with a garbage collector, either as the primary
                 means of storage reclamation, or as a debugging tool.
                 Our approach has two potential disadvantages. First,
                 some garbage may fail to be reclaimed. Secondly, we use
                 a 'stop and collect' approach, thus making the strategy
                 unsuitable for applications with severe real-time
                 constraints. We argue that the first problem is, to
                 some extent, inherent in any garbage collection system.
                 Furthermore, based on our experience, it is usually not
                 significant in practice. In spite of the second
                 problem, we have had favourable experiences with

   "Static analysis is usually faster than dynamic analysis but less
    precise. Therefore it is often desirable to retain information from
    static analysis for run-time verification, or to compare the results of
    both techniques. However, this requires writing two [analysis]
    programs, which may not act identically under the same conditions. It
    would be desirable to share the same generic algorithm by static and
    dynamic analysis. In JNuke, a framework for static and dynamic analysis
    of Java programs, this has been achieved. By keeping the architecture
    of static analysis similar to a virtual machine, the only key
    difference between abstract interpretation and execution remains the
    nature of program states. In dynamic analysis, concrete states are
    available, while in static analysis, sets of (abstract) states are
    considered. Our new analysis is generic because it can re-use the same
    algorithm in static analysis and dynamic analysis. This paper describes
    the architecture of such a generic analysis. To our knowledge, JNuke is
    the first tool that has achieved this integration, which enables static
    and dynamic analysis to interact in novel ways.",

   "The problem of enforcing correct usage of array and pointer references
    in C and C++ programs remains unsolved. The approach proposed by Jones
    and Kelly (extended by Ruwase and Lam) is the only one we know of that
    does not require significant manual changes to programs, but it has
    extremely high overheads of 5x-6x and 11x-12x in the two versions. In
    this paper, we describe a collection of techniques that dramatically
    reduce the overhead of this approach, by exploiting a fine-grain
    partitioning of memory called Automatic Pool Allocation. Together,
    these techniques bring the average overhead checks down to only 12\% for
    a set of benchmarks (but 69\% for one case). We show that the memory
    partitioning is key to bringing down this overhead. We also show that
    our technique successfully detects all buffer overrun violations in a
    test suite modeling reported violations in some important real-world
    programs."

                 computer systems is a key obstacle to achieving high
                 processor utilization. Furthermore, the technology
                 trends indicate that this gap between processor and
                 memory speeds is likely to increase in the future.
                 While increased latency affects all computer systems,
                 the problem is magnified in large-scale shared-memory
                 multiprocessors, where physical dimensions cause
                 latency to be an inherent problem. To cope with the
                 memory latency problem, the basic solution that nearly
                 all computer systems rely on is their cache hierarchy.
                 While caches are useful, they are not a panacea.
                 Software-controlled prefetching is a technique for
                 tolerating memory latency by explicitly executing
                 prefetch instructions to move data close to the
                 processor before it is actually needed. This technique
                 is attractive because it can hide both read and write
                 latency within a single thread of execution while
                 requiring relatively little hardware support.
                 Software-controlled prefetching, however, presents two
                 major challenges. First, some sophistication is
                 required on the part of either the programmer, runtime
                 system, or (preferably) the compiler to insert
                 prefetches into the code. Second, care must be taken
                 that the overheads of prefetching, which include
                 additional instructions and increased memory queueing
                 delays, do not outweigh the benefits. This dissertation
                 proposes and evaluates a new compiler algorithm for
                 inserting prefetches into code. The proposed algorithm
                 attempts to minimize overheads by only issuing
                 prefetches for references that are predicted to suffer
                 cache misses. The algorithm can prefetch both
                 dense-matrix and sparse-matrix codes, thus covering a
                 large fraction of scientific applications. It also
                 works for both uniprocessor and large-scale
                 shared-memory multiprocessor architectures. We have
                 implemented our algorithm in the SUIF (Stanford
                 University Intermediate Form) optimizing compiler. The
                 results of our detailed architectural simulations
                 demonstrate that the speed of some applications can be
                 improved by as much as a factor of two, both on
                 uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems. This
                 dissertation also compares software-controlled
                 prefetching with other latency-hiding techniques (e.g.,
                 locality optimizations, relaxed consistency models, and
                 multithreading), and investigates the architectural
                 support necessary to make prefetching effective.",

                 speculative thread- level execution on a single-chip
                 multiprocessor. A detailed analysis of programs using
                 the TLS execution model shows a bound on the
                 performance of a TLS machine that is promising. In
                 particular, TLS makes it feasible to find speculative

                 improve the performance of general-purpose
                 applications. Exploiting speculative thread-level
                 parallelism on a multiprocessor requires the compiler
                 to determine where to speculate, and to generate SPMD

                 logically preceding instruction on which it may be data

                 succeeds; if not, it fails, and the two instructions

                 on techniques to ensure correct execution while
                 carrying data speculation. The issue of improving the
                 accuracy of data speculation - especially dynamic
                 techniques to do so - has not received attention.
                 However, as we demonstrate, the need for accurate data
                 speculation becomes more acute as ILP processors
                 sustain ever increasing instruction windows. In this

                 accuracy with which data speculation of memory values
                 is carried out. We present dynamic techniques: (i) to
                 predict if the execution of an instruction is likely to
                 result in a data misspeculation, and (ii) to provide
                 the synchronization needed to avoid a misspeculation.

                 the proposed techniques are presented within the

                 dissertation, automatically transforms a sequential
                 Lisp program into an equivalent concurrent program that
                 executes on a multiprocessor. CURARE first analyzes a
                 program to find its control and data dependences. This
                 analysis is most difficult for references to structures
                 connected by pointers. CURARE uses a new
                 data-dependence algorithm, which finds and classifies
                 these dependencies. The analysis is conservative and
                 may detect conflicts that do not arise in practice. A
                 programmer can temper and refine its results with
                 declarations. Dependences constrain the program's
                 concurrent execution because, in general, two
                 conflicting statements cannot execute in a different
                 order without affecting the program's result. A
                 restructurer must know all dependences in order to
                 preserve them. However, not all dependences are
                 essential to produce the program's result. CURARE
                 attempts to transform the program so it computes its
                 result with fewer conflicts. An optimized program will
                 execute with less synchronization and more concurrency.
                 CURARE then examines loops in a program to find those
                 that are unconstrained or lightly constrained by
                 dependences. By necessity, CURARE treats recursive
                 functions as loops and does not limit itself to
                 explicit program loops. Recursive functions offer
                 Several advantages over explicit loops since they
                 provide a convenient framework for inserting locks and
                 handling the dynamic behavior of symbolic programs.
                 Loops that are suitable for concurrent execution are
                 changed to execute on a set of concurrent server
                 processes. These servers execute single loop iterations
                 and therefore need to be extremely inexpensive to
                 invoke. Restructured programs execute significantly
                 faster than the original sequential programs. This
                 improvement is large enough to attract programmers to a
                 multiprocessor, particularly since it requires little
                 effort on their part. Although restructured programs
                 may not make optimal use of a multiprocessor's
                 parallelism, they make good use of a programmer's
                 time.",
