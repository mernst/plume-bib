   "The success of a computer system depends upon a user \emph{choosing} it,
    but the field of Human-Computer Interaction has little ability to predict
    this user choice. We present a new method that measures user choice, and
    quantifies it as a measure of \emph{utility}. Our method has two core
    features.  First, it introduces an economic definition of utility, one that
    we can operationalize through economic experiments.  Second, we employ a
    novel method of crowdsourcing that enables the collection of thousands of
    economic judgments from real users.",
