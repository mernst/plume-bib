  abstract =
   "A \emph{memory leak} in a garbage-collected program occurs when the program
    inadvertently maintains references to objects that it no longer
    needs. Memory leaks cause systematic heap growth, degrading performance and
    resulting in program crashes after perhaps days or weeks of
    execution. Prior approaches for detecting memory leaks rely on heap
    differencing or detailed object statistics which store state proportional
    to the number of objects in the heap. These overheads preclude their use on
    the same processor for deployed long-running applications.
    \par
    This paper introduces a dynamic heap-summarization technique based on type
    that accurately identifies leaks, is space efficient (adding less than 1%
    to the heap), and is time efficient (adding 2.3% on average to total
    execution time). We implement this approach in \emph{Cork} which utilizes
    dynamic type information and garbage collection to summarize the live
    objects in a \emph{type points-from graph} (\emph{TPFG}) whose nodes
    (types) and edges (references between types) are annotated with
    volume. \emph{Cork} compares \emph{TPFG}s across multiple collections,
    identifies growing data structures, and computes a \emph{type slice} for
    the user. \emph{Cork} is accurate: it identifies systematic heap growth
    with no false positives in 4 of 15 benchmarks we tested. Cork's slice
    report enabled us (non-experts) to quickly eliminate growing data
    structures in SPECjbb2000 and Eclipse, something their developers had not
    previously done. Cork is accurate, scalable, and efficient enough to
    consider using online.",
