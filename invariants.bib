   "Dynamic invariant detection is an approach that has received considerable
    attention in the recent research literature. A natural question arises in
    languages that separate the interface of a code module from its
    implementation: does an inferred invariant describe the interface or the
    implementation? Furthermore, if an implementation is allowed to refine
    another, as, for instance, in object-oriented method overriding, what is
    the relation between the inferred invariants of the overriding and the
    overridden method? The problem is of great practical interest. Invariants
    derived by real tools, like Daikon, often suffer from internal
    inconsistencies when overriding is taken into account, becoming unsuitable
    for some automated uses. We discuss the interactions between overriding and
    inferred invariants, and describe the implementation of an invariant
    inference tool that produces consistent invariants for interfaces and
    overridden methods.",

   "Dynamic invariant detection, the automatic recovery of partial program

    been successful in the context of procedural programs. The implementation
    for dynamic invariant detection examines only the declared type of a
    variable, lacking many details in the context of object-oriented
    programs. This paper shows how this technique can be extended to detect
    invariants of object-oriented programs in the presence of polymorphism by
    examining the runtime type of a polymorphic variable, which may have
    different declared and runtime types. We demonstrate the improved accuracy
    of the dynamically detected specification on two real-world examples: the
    Money example from the JUnit testing framework tutorial, and a database
    query engine model example, which we adopted from a commercial database

   "The languages of current dynamic constraint detection techniques are

    the dynamically recovered specification more expressive and
    program-specific we propose the state space partitioning technique as a
    solution which effectively adds program-specific disjunctive properties

    partitioning technique which relies on Daikon for dynamic constraint
    inference tasks.

    develop a methodology which allows us to measure quantitatively how

abstract = "Abstract The wide adoption of Web Services has led to the development of languages to compose them, like the WS-BPEL standard. In order to check whether the composition works as expected, one common approach is to analyze it and infer functional properties describing its behavior. Traditional approaches for inferring properties in WS-BPEL have been static: compositions are transformed into specialized analysis models based on some formalization. However, this formalization could be inexact due to theoretical limitations or differing interpretations of the standard by implementers. Dynamic invariant generation solves these problems by extracting the properties from actual executions and has been successfully used in popular languages, but not to WS-BPEL yet. In this work, we apply dynamic invariant generation to WS-BPEL, providing innovative solutions for several features that require special consideration, like highly multidimensional values in variables, an advanced type system or unstructured code. We have implemented these solutions in Takuan and evaluated its performance with several compositions of varying complexity. We present the results obtained and a comparative analysis of the efficiency and effectiveness of our solutions. Results show that the solutions are successful in reducing the cost of applying dynamic invariant generation and the number of uninteresting invariants generated. "

    strongly focuses on black-box comparison of program outputs. Program
    spectra have recently been proposed to characterize a program s behavior
    inside the black box. Comparing program spectra of program versions offers
    insights into the internal behavior differences between versions. In this
    paper, we present a new class of program spectra, value spectra, which
    enriches the existing program spectra family. We compare the value spectra
    of an old version and a new version to detect internal behavior deviations
    in the new version. We use a deviation-propagation call tree to present the
    deviation details. Based on the deviation-propagation call tree, we propose
    two heuristics to locate deviation roots, which are program locations that
    trigger the behavior deviations. We have conducted an experiment on seven C
    programs to evaluate our approach. The results show that our approach can
    effectively expose program behavior differences between versions even when
    their program outputs are the same, and our approach reports deviation
    roots with high accuracy for most programs.",

    analysis if the variables and expressions whose values will be monitored at
    runtime are known in advance. On the other hand, the dynamic analysis may
    be run first using an available test suite to obtain an initial guess of

   "\emph{Mutation testing} measures the adequacy of a test suite by seeding
    artificial defects (mutations) into a program. If a mutation is not
    detected by the test suite, this usually means that the test suite is not
    adequate. However, it may also be that the mutant keeps the program's
    semantics unchanged-and thus cannot be detected by any test. Such
    \emph{equivalent mutants} have to be eliminated manually, which is tedious.
    \par
    We assess the impact of mutations by checking dynamic invariants. In an
    evaluation of our JAVALANCHE framework on seven industrial-size programs,
    we found that mutations that violate invariants are significantly more
    likely to be detectable by a test suite. As a consequence, mutations with
    impact on invariants should be focused upon when improving test
    suites. With less than 3\% of equivalent mutants, our approach provides an
    efficient, precise, and fully automatic measure of the adequacy of a test

   "Enterprise systems must guarantee high availability and reliability to
    provide 24/7 services without interruptions and failures. Mechanisms for
    handling exceptional cases and implementing fault tolerance techniques can
    reduce failure occurrences, and increase dependability. Most of such
    mechanisms address major problems that lead to unexpected service
    termination or crashes, but do not deal with many subtle domain dependent
    failures that do not necessarily cause service termination or crashes, but
    result in incorrect results.
    \par
    In this paper, we propose a technique for developing self-protecting
    systems. The technique proposed in this paper observes values at relevant
    program points. When the technique detects a software failure, it uses the
    collected information to identify the execution contexts that lead to the
    failure, and automatically enables mechanisms for preventing future
    occurrences of failures of the same type. Thus, failures do not occur again
    after the first detection of a failure of the same type."

    verification from single components to component integration. Independent
    teams and organizations develop COTS components without referring to
    specific systems or interaction patterns. Developing systems that reuse
    COTS components (even high-quality ones) therefore presents new
    compatibility problems. David Garlan, Robert Allen, and John Ockerbloom
    (1995) reported that in their experience, integrating four COTS components
    took 10 person-years (rather than the one planned person-year), mainly
    because of integration problems. According to Barry Boehm and Chris Abts
    (1999), three of the four main problems with reusing COTS products are
    absence of control over their functionality, absence of control over their
    evolution, and lack of design for interoperability. Our proposed technique,
    called behavior capture and test, detects COTS component incompatibilities
    by dynamically analyzing component behavior. BCT incrementally builds
    behavioral models of components and compares them with the behavior the
    components display when reused in new contexts. This lets us identify
    incompatibilities, unexpected interactions, untested behaviors, and
    dangerous side effects.",

   "Current trends in the embedded and real-time software industry are leading
    towards the use of object-oriented programming languages such as Java.
    From the software engineering perspective, one of the most attractive
    issues in object-oriented design is the encapsulation of abstractions into
    objects that communicate through clearly defined interfaces.
    \par
    However, in order to be able to successfully adopt languages with object
    oriented features like Java in embedded and real-time systems, is necessary
    to solve at least two problems: eliminate execution unpredictability due to
    garbage collection and automatically analyze memory requirements.
    \par
    There has been some work trying to deal with the first problem but the
    problem of computing memory requirements is still challenging. In this
    thesis we present our approach to tackle both problems by presenting
    solutions towards more predictable memory management and predicting memory
    requirements. The effort is mainly focused in the latter problem as we
    found it hard, less explored, strongly relevant for all kinds of embedded
    systems and its applicability and usefulness is beyond real-time
    applications.
    \par
    This thesis presents a series of techniques to automatically compute
    dynamic memory utilization certificates. We start by computing a technique
    that produces parametric specifications of memory allocations without
    consider any memory reclaiming mechanism. Then, we approximate object
    lifetime using escape analysis and synthesize a scoped-based memory
    organization where object are organized in regions that can be collected as
    a whole. We propose a technique to automatically translate conventional
    Java code into code that safely adopts this memory management
    mechanism. Under this new setting we infer parametric specifications of the
    size of each memory regions. Finally, we predict the minimum amount of
    dynamic memory required to run a method (or program) in the context of
    scoped memory management by computing parametric specifications of the size
    of memory regions and by modeling the potential configurations of the
    regions in run time.
    \par
    We develop a prototype tool that implemented the complete chain of
    techniques and allow us to experimentally evaluate the efficiency and
    accuracy of the method on several Java benchmarks. The results are very
    encouraging.",

                 dense clusters in subspaces of maximum dimensionality.
                 It generates cluster descriptions in the form of DNF
                 expressions that are minimized for ease of

   "Some recent work [7, 14, 15] in computational learning theory has discussed
    learning in situations where the teacher is helpful, and can choose to
    present carefully chosen sequences of labelled examples to the learner. We
    say a function t in a set H of functions (a hypothesis space) defined on a
    set X is specified by S***X if the only function in H which agrees with t
    on S is t itself. The specification number &sgr;(t) of t is the least
    cardinality of such an S. For a general hypothesis space, we show that the
    specification number of any hypothesis is at least equal to a parameter from
    [14] known as the testing dimension of H. We investigate in some detail the
    specification numbers of hypotheses in the set Hn of linearly separable
    boolean functions: We present general methods for finding upper bounds on
    &sgr;(t) and we characterise those t which have largest &sgr;(t). We obtain
    a general lower bound on the number of examples required and we show that
    for all nested hypotheses, this lower bound is attained. We prove that for
    any t &egr; Hn, there is exactly one set of examples of minimal cardinality
    (i.e., of cardinality &sgr;(t)) which specifies t. We then discuss those t
    &egr; Hn which have limited dependence, in the sense that some of the
    variables are redundant (i.e., there are irrelevant attributes), giving
    tight upper and lower bounds on &sgr;(t) for such hypotheses. In the final
    section of the paper, we address the complexity of computing specification
    numbers and related parameters.",

                 be successful, it is possible to produce documentation
                 that makes it appear that the software was designed by
                 such a process. The ideal process and the documentation
                 that it requires are described. The authors explain why
                 one should attempt to design according to the ideal
                 process and why one should produce the documentation
                 that would have been produced by that process. The

		 other end, it embodies a lightweight formal method in
		 which subtle properties of behaviour can be investigated.
                 \\
		 Alcoa's input language, Alloy, is a new notation based on
		 Z. Its development was motivated by the need for a
		 notation that is more closely tailored to object models
		 (in the style of UML), and more amenable to automatic
		 analysis. Like Z, Alloy supports the description of
		 systems whose state involves complex relational
		 structure. State and behavioural properties are described
		 declaratively, by conjoining constraints. This makes it
		 possible to develop and analyze a model incrementally,
		 with Alcoa investigating the consequences of whatever
		 constraints are given.
                 \\
		 Alcoa works by translating constraints to boolean
		 formulas, and then applying state-of-the-art SAT
		 solvers. It can analyze billions of states in seconds."

    can be substituted for another or how one can be modified to fit the
    requirements of the other. In the context of object-oriented programming,
    it can help determine when one type is a behavioral subtype of another. We
    use formal specifications to describe the behavior of software components
    and, hence, to determine whether two components match. We give precise
    definitions of not just exact match, but, more relevantly, various flavors
    of relaxed match. These definitions capture the notions of generalization,
    specialization, and substitutability of software components. Since our
    formal specifications are pre- and postconditions written as predicates in
    first-order logic, we rely on theorem proving to determine match and
    mismatch. We give examples from our implementation of specification
    matching using the Larch Prover."

                 proposes software and hardware mechanisms that support
                 speculative thread- level execution on a single-chip
                 multiprocessor. A detailed analysis of programs using
                 the TLS execution model shows a bound on the
                 performance of a TLS machine that is promising. In
                 particular, TLS makes it feasible to find speculative
                 do across parallelism in outer loops that can greatly
                 improve the performance of general-purpose
                 applications. Exploiting speculative thread-level
                 parallelism on a multiprocessor requires the compiler
                 to determine where to speculate, and to generate SPMD
                 (single program multiple data) code.We have developed a
                 fully automatic compiler system that uses profile
                 information to determine the best loops to execute
                 speculatively, and to generate the synchronization code
                 that improves the performance of speculative execution.
                 The hardware mechanisms required to support speculation
                 are simple extensions to the cache hierarchy of a
                 single chip multiprocessor. We show that with our

  abstract =     "When proving invariance properties of programs one is
                 faced with two problems. The first problem is related
                 to the necessity of proving tautologies of the
                 considered assertion language, whereas the second
                 manifests in the need of finding sufficiently strong
                 invariants. This paper focuses on the second problem
                 and describes techniques for the automatic generation
                 of invariants. The first set of these techniques is
                 applicable on sequential transition systems and allows
                 to derive so-called local invariants, i.e. predicates
                 which are invariants at some control location. The
                 second is applicable on networks of transition systems
                 and allows to combine local invariants of the
                 sequential components to obtain local invariants of the
                 global systems. Furthermore, refined strengthening
                 technique is presented that allows to avoid the problem
                 of size-increase of the considered predicates which is
                 the main drawback of the usual strengthening technique.
                 The proposed techniques are illustrated by examples.",

   "Automatic generation of state invariants, properties that hold in every
    reachable state of a state machine model, can be valuable in software
    development. Not only can such invariants be presented to system users for
    validation, in addition, they can be used as auxiliary assertions in
    proving other invariants. This paper describes an algorithm for the
    automatic generation of state invariants that, in contrast to most other
    such algorithms, which operate on programs, derives invariants from
    requirements specifications. Generating invariants from requirements
    specifications rather than programs has two advantages: 1) because
    requirements specifications, unlike programs, are at a high level of
    abstraction, generation of and analysis using such invariants is easier,
    and 2) using invariants to detect errors during the requirements phase is
    considerably more cost-effective than using invariants later in software
    development. To illustrate the algorithm, we use it to generate state
    invariants from requirements specifications of an automobile cruise control
    system and a simple control system for a nuclear plant. The invariants are
    derived from specifications expressed in the SCR (Software Cost Reduction)
    tabular notation.",

    using model checking is advancing rapidly. Work on extracting finite-state

    on enabling the tractable checking of program properties such as freedom
    from deadlock and assertion violations. For the most part, the problem of
    specifying more general program properties has not been considered. In this
    paper, we report on the support for specifying properties of dynamic
    multi-threaded Java programs that we have built into the Bandera
    system. Bandera extracts finite-state models, in the input format of
    several existing model checkers, from Java code based on the property to be
    checked. The Bandera Specification Language (BSL) provides a language for
    defining general assertions and pre/post conditions on methods. It also
    supports the definition of observations that can be made of the state of
    program objects and the incorporation of those observations as predicates
    that can be instantiated in the scope of object quantifiers and used in
    describing common forms of state/event sequencing properties. We illustrate
    how BSL can be used to formulate a variety of system correctness properties
    for several multi-threaded Java applications.",

   "The Temporal Rover is a specification based verification tool for
    applications written in C, C++, Java, Verilog and VHDL. The tool combines
    formal specification, using Linear-Time Temporal Logic (LTL) and Metric
    Temporal Logic (MTL), with conventional simulation/execution based
    testing. The Temporal Rover is tailored for the verification of complex
    protocols and reactive systems where behavior is time dependent. The
    Temporal Rover generates executable code from LTL and MTL assertions
    written as comments in the source code. This executable source code is
    compiled and linked as part of the application under test. During
    application execution the generated code validates the executing program
    against the formal temporal specification requirements. Using MTL, real
    time and relative time constraints can be validated. A special code
    generator supports validation of such constraints in the field, on an
    embedded target."

   "Program specifications are important for many tasks during software design,
    development, and maintenance. Among these, temporal specifications are
    particularly useful. They express formal correctness requirements of an
    application's ordering of specific actions and events during execution,
    such as the strict alternation of acquisition and release of locks. Despite
    their importance, temporal specifications are often missing, incomplete, or
    described only informally. Many techniques have been proposed that mine
    such specifications from execution traces or program source code. However,
    existing techniques mine only simple patterns, or they mine a single
    complex pattern that is restricted to a particular set of manually selected
    events. There is no practical, automatic technique that can mine general
    temporal properties from execution traces.
    \par
    In this paper, we present Javert, the first general specification mining
    framework that can learn, fully automatically, complex temporal properties
    from execution traces. The key insight behind Javert is that real, complex
    specifications can be formed by composing instances of small generic
    patterns, such as the alternating pattern ($(ab)*$) and the resource usage
    pattern ($(ab*c)*$). In particular, Javert learns simple generic patterns and
    composes them using sound rules to construct large, complex
    specifications. We have implemented the algorithm in a practical tool and
    conducted an extensive empirical evaluation on several open source software
    projects. Our results are promising; they show that Javert is scalable,
    general, and precise. It discovered many interesting, nontrivial
    specifications in real-world code that are beyond the reach of existing
    automatic techniques.",

  abstract =
   "Many testing and analysis techniques use finite state models to validate
    and verify the quality of software systems. Since the specification of such
    models is complex and time-consuming, researchers defined several
    techniques to extract finite state models from code and
    traces. Automatically generating models requires much less effort than
    designing them, and thus eases the verification and validation of large
    software systems. However, when models are inferred automatically, the
    precision of the mining process is critical. Behavioral models mined with
    imprecise processes can include many spurious behaviors, and can thus
    compromise the results of testing and analysis techniques that use those
    models.
    \par
    In this paper, we increase the precision of automata inferred from
    execution traces, by leveraging two learning techniques. We first mine
    execution traces to infer statistically significant temporal properties
    that capture relations between non consecutive and possibly distant
    events. We then incrementally refine a simple initial automaton by merging
    likely equivalent states. We identify equivalent states by analyzing set of
    consecutive events, and we use the inferred temporal properties to evaluate
    whether two equivalent states can be merged or not. We merge equivalent
    states only if the merging does violate any temporal property, since a
    merging that violates temporal properties is likely to introduce an
    imprecise generalization. Our generalization process that preserves
    temporal properties while merging states avoids breaking non-local
    relations, and thus solves one of the major cause of overgeneralized
    models. Thus, mined properties steer the learning of behavioral models. The
    technique is completely automated and generates an automaton that both
    accepts the input traces and satisfies the mined temporal properties.
    \par
    We evaluated our solution by comparing models inferred with and without
    checking mined temporal properties. Results show that our steering process
    can significantly improve precision without noticeable loss of recall.",

   "Object invariants describe the consistency of object-oriented data
    structures and are central to reasoning about the correctness of
    object-oriented software. Yet, reasoning about object invariants in the
    presence of object references, methods, and subclassing is difficult. This
    paper describes a methodology for specifying and verifying object-oriented
    programs, using object invariants to specify the consistency of data and
    using ownership to organize objects into contexts. The novelty is that
    contexts can be dynamic: there is no bound on the number of objects in a
    context and objects can be transferred between contexts. The invariant of
    an object is allowed to depend on the fields of the object, on the fields
    of all objects in transitively-owned contexts, and on fields of objects
    reachable via given sequences of fields. With these invariants, one can
    describe a large variety of properties, including properties of cyclic data
    structures. Object invariants can be declared in or near the classes whose
    fields they depend on, not necessarily in the class of an owning
    object. The methodology is designed to allow modular reasoning, even in the
    presence of subclasses, and is proved sound."

   "JML is a behavioral interface specification language tailored to Java(TM).
    Besides pre- and postconditions, it also allows assertions to be

    designed to be used by working software engineers; to do this it follows
    Eiffel in using Java expressions in assertions.  JML combines this idea
    from Eiffel with the model-based approach to specifications, typified by
    VDM and Larch, which results in greater expressiveness.  Other
    expressiveness advantages over Eiffel include quantifiers,
    specification-only variables, and frame conditions.This paper discusses
    the goals of JML, the overall approach, and describes the basic features

    behaviors of a set of benign programs.  In other words, we mine the

    of benign programs.  The output of our algorithm can be used by malware
    detectors to detect malware variants.  Since our algorithm provides a
    succinct description of malicious behavior present in a malware, it can
    also be used by security analysts for understanding the malware.  We have

    The past few years have seen a plethora of object-oriented languages

    In the second part of this thesis, we study a tool that makes it
    easier to change programs with type annotations.  The tool uses type
    inference to automate the management of type annotations.

    The third part of the thesis concerns the use of type inference tools

   "Dynamically discovering likely program invariants from concrete test
    executions has emerged as a highly promising software engineering
    technique. Dynamic invariant inference has the advantage of succinctly
    summarizing both ``expected'' program inputs and the subset of program
    behaviors that is normal under those inputs. In this paper, we introduce
    a technique that can drastically increase the relevance of inferred
    invariants, or reduce the size of the test suite required to obtain good
    invariants. Instead of falsifying invariants produced by pre-set
    patterns, we determine likely program invariants by combining the
    concrete execution of actual test cases with a simultaneous symbolic
    execution of the same tests. The symbolic execution produces abstract
    conditions over program variables that the concrete tests satisfy during
    their execution. In this way, we obtain the benefits of dynamic
    inference tools like Daikon: the inferred invariants correspond to the
    observed program behaviors. At the same time, however, our inferred
    invariants are much more suited to the program at hand than Daikon's
    hard-coded invariant patterns. The symbolic invariants are literally
    derived from the program text itself, with appropriate value
    substitutions as dictated by symbolic execution. We implemented our
    technique in the DySy tool, which utilizes a powerful symbolic execution
    and simplification engine. The results confirm the benefits of our

    a significant contributor to these instabilities, and describes some
    techniques to detect and prevent them. At their core, the contributed

    annotate, rewrite, and analyze user-written quantifiers to improve the
    solver's performance, using information that is easily available at the
    source level but would be hard to extract from the heavily encoded terms

                 classes and enforce Design By Contract constructs. The
                 designer of a class specifies a contract by defining
                 protected methods which conform to the jContractor
                 design patterns. jContractor uses Java Reflection to
                 synthesize an instrumented version of a Java class
                 containing jContractor contract specifications. The
                 instrumented version contains code which enforces the

                  In [9], [10] and [11] Parnas et al. advocate the use of a
                  relational model for documenting the intended behaviour
                  of programs. In this method, tabular expressions are used
                  to improve readability so that formal documentation can
                  replace conventional documentation. Relations are
                  described by giving their characteristic predicate in
                  terms of the values of concrete program variables. This

                  -- it simply must be evaluated for each test execution
                  (input & output) to assign pass or fail. In contrast to
                  [1], this paper discusses the testing of individual
                  programs, not objects as used in [1]. Consequently, the

                  of the concrete variables, and no representation function
                  need be supplied. Documentation in this form, and the

    independent of system vulnerabilities and are highly effective in
    identifying intrusions. The technique employs a machine learning method,
    Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), for synthesizing first order logic
    formulas that describe the valid operations of a program from the normal
    runs of the program. ILP, backed by theories and techniques extended from
    computational logic, allows the use of complex domain-specific background
    knowledge in the learning process to produce sound and consistent
    knowledge. A specification induction engine has been developed by extending
    an existing ILP tool and has been used to construct specifications for
    several (> 10) privileged programs in Unix. Coupling with rich background
    knowledge in systems and security, the prototype induction engine generates
    human understandable and analyzable specifications that are as good as
    those specified by a human. Preliminary experiments with existing attacks
    show that the generated specifications are highly effective in detecting
    attacks that subvert privileged programs to gain unauthorized accesses to

    address an important vulnerability in mobile code security that exists in
    remote execution systems such as Condor, Globus, and SETI{\atsign}Home.
    These systems schedule user jobs for execution on remote idle machines.
    However, they send most of their important system calls back to the local
    machine for execution. Hence, an evil process on the remote machine can
    manipulate a user's job to send destructive system calls back to the local
    machine. We have developed techniques to remotely detect such manipulation.
    \par
    Before the job is submitted for remote execution, we construct a model of
    the user's binary program using static analysis. This binary analysis is
    applicable to commodity remote execution systems and applications. During
    remote job execution, the model checks all system calls arriving at the
    local machine. Execution is only allowed to continue while the model
    remains valid. We begin with a finite-state machine model that accepts
    sequences of system calls and then build optimizations into the model to
    improve its precision and efficiency. We also propose two program
    transformations, renaming and null call insertion, that have a significant
    impact on the precision and efficiency. As a desirable side-effect, these
    techniques also obfuscate the program, thus making it harder for the
    adversary to reverse engineer the code. We have implemented a simulated
    remote execution environment to demonstrate how optimizations and
    transformations of the binary program increase the precision and
    efficiency. In our test programs, unoptimized models increase run-time by
    0.5\% or less. At moderate levels of optimization, run-time increases by
    less than 13\% with precision gains reaching 74\%."

   "This paper describes new techniques to help with testing and debugging,
    using information obtained from path profiling. A path profiler instruments
    a program so that the number of times each different loop-free path
    executes is accumulated during an execution run. With such an instrumented
    program, each run of the program generates a path spectrum for the
    execution --- a distribution of the paths that were executed during that
    run. A path spectrum is a finite, easily obtainable characterization of a
    program's execution on a dataset, and provides a behavior signature for a
    run of the program.
    \par
	Our techniques are based on the idea of comparing path spectra from
    different runs of the program. When different runs produce different
    spectra, the spectral differences can be used to identify paths in the
    program along which control diverges in the two runs. By choosing input
    datasets to hold all factors constant except one, the divergence can be
    attributed to this factor. The point of divergence itself may not be the
    cause of the underlying problem, but provides a starting place for a
    programmer to begin his exploration.
    \par
	One application of this technique is in the ``Year 2000 Problem''
    (i.e., the problem of fixing computer systems that use only 2-digit year
    fields in date-valued data). In this context, path-spectrum comparison
    provides a heuristic for identifying paths in a program that are good
    candidates for being date-dependent computations. The application of
    path-spectrum comparison to a number of other software-maintenance issues
    is also discussed.

                 of software error detection using self checks and
                 N-version voting. A total of 24 graduate students in
                 computer science at the University of Virginia and the
                 University of California, Irvine, were hired as
                 programmers. Working independently, each first prepared
                 a set of self checks to an existing implementation of
                 that specification. The modified programs were executed
                 to measure the error-detection performance of the
                 checks and to compare this with error detection using
                 simple voting among multiple versions. The goal of this
                 study was to learn more about the effectiveness of such
                 checks. The analysis of the checks revealed that there
                 are great differences in the ability of individual
                 programmers to design effective checks. We found that
                 some checks which might have been effective failed to
                 detect an error because they were badly placed, and
                 there were numerous instances of checks signaling
                 nonexistent errors. In general, specification-based
                 checks alone were not as effective as combining them
                 with code-based checks. Using self checks, faults were
                 identified that had not been detected previously by
                 voting 28 versions of the program over a million
                 randomly-generated inputs. This appeared to result from
                 the fact that the self checks could examine the
                 internal state of the executing program whereas voting
                 examines only the final results of computations. If
                 internal states had to be consistent in N-version
                 voting systems, then there would be no reason to write
                 multiple versions. The programs were executed on 100,000
                 new randomly-generated input cases in order to
                 compare error detection by self checks and by 2-version
                 and 3-version voting. Both self checks and voting
                 techniques led to the identification of the same number
                 of faults for this input, although the identified
                 faults were not the same. Furthermore, whereas the self
                 checks were always effective at detecting an error
                 caused by a particular fault (if they ever did),
                 N-version voting triples and pairs were only partially
                 effective at detecting the failures caused by
                 particular faults. Finally, checking the internal state
                 with self checks also resulted in finding faults that
                 did not cause failures for the particular input case
                 executed. This has important implications for the use
                 of back-to-back testing.",

   "This paper documents the rapid implementation of a system for
    visualisation of the execution of C++ programs on a Unix system.  The
    system was to produce dynamic diagrams representing data and control
    structures so as to assist programmers determine reusable components
    within the program. Such a system would normally involve a considerable
    amount of low-level and high-level programming, but we avoided much of
    thus by extensive use of several programming tools.
    \par
      We first used the Gnu C++ debugger Gdb, which allows interactive
    control of C++ program execution, and retrieval of textual information
    about the program. We then used Expect, a system that allows automatic
    control of a text interface of a program, to retrieve information about
    the C++ program using Gdb. In conjunction with Expect, we used the
    scripting language Tcl and user interface toolkit Tk to analyse the
    information, draw diagrams, and provide user control.
    \par
      The end result was a successful program visualisation system produced
    in a fraction of the time that would otherwise have been necessary. While
    program visualisation is a relatively specialised application, all this
    technology would be similarly useful for many other applications."

    failures have been detected. In this paper, we investigate how the
    instrumentation of contracts could address this issue. Contracts are
    known to be a useful technique to specify the precondition and
    postcondition of operations and class invariants, thus making the
    definition of object-oriented analysis or design elements more
    precise. Our aim in this paper is to reuse and instrument contracts to
    ease testing. A thorough case study is run where we define contracts,
    instrument them using a commercial tool, and assess the benefits and
    limitations of doing so to support the isolation of faults. We then draw
    practical conclusions regarding the applicability of the approach and
    its limitations."

    built by integrating multiple distributed components. We suggest providing
    components with multiple implementations, each optimized for a particular
    workload, and augmenting the component run-time environment with a
    mechanism for switching between implementations. This mechanism monitors
    the types of requests the component is receiving, and adaptively switches
    implementations for optimal application performance. Achieving this optimal
    performance depends on making good choices as to when and how to switch
    implementations, a problem we refer to as the adaptive component
    problem. We first formalize the generic problem, and then provide an
    algorithm, named Delta, for switching implementations in the special case
    when the component has exactly two implementations. We show that this
    algorithm is (3+epsilon)-competitive with respect to the optimal algorithm,
    where epsilon is a small fraction. We establish a 3-competitive lower bound
    for the problem, which implies that Delta is close to optimal. We describe
    two applications of these results to the distributed pub/sub problem, and

    services. The authors have developed a prototype on the basis of these
    ideas and tested their system by generating OWL-S descriptions for some of

    constraints imposed by the environment. Moreover, they must fully explore
    and integrate many novel power management techniques. Unfortunately, these
    techniques are often incompatible with each other due to overspecialized
    formulations or they fail to consider system-wide issues. This paper
    proposes a new graph-based model to integrate novel power management
    techniques and facilitate design-space exploration of power-aware embedded
    systems. It captures min/max timing and min/max power constraints on
    computation and non-computation tasks through a new constraint
    classification and enables derivation of flexible system-level
    schedules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model with a
    power-aware scheduler on real mission-critical applications. Experimental
    results show that our automated techniques can improve performance and
    reduce energy cost simultaneously. The application model and scheduling
    tool presented in this paper form the basis of the IMPACCT system-level
    framework that will enable designers to aggressively explore many
    power-performance trade-offs with confidence."

   "Correctly predicting the direction that branches will take is
    increasingly important in today's wide-issue computer architectures. The
    name {\em program-based\/} branch prediction is given to static branch
    prediction techniques that base their prediction on a program's
    structure. In this article, we investigate a new approach to program-based
    branch prediction that uses a body of existing programs to predict the
    branch behavior in a new program. We call this approach to program-based
    branch prediction {\em evidence-based static prediction\/}, or ESP. The
    main idea of ESP is that the behavior of a corpus of programs can be used
    to infer the behavior of new programs. In this article, we use neural
    networks and decision trees to map static features associated with each
    branch to a prediction that the branch will be taken. ESP shows significant
    advantages over other prediction mechanisms.  Specifically, it is a
    program-based technique; it is effective across a range of programming
    languages and programming styles; and it does not rely on the use of
    expert-defined heuristics. In this article, we describe the application of
    ESP to the problem of static branch prediction and compare our results to
    existing program-based branch predictors. We also investigate the
    applicability of ESP across computer architectures, programming languages,
    compilers, and run-time systems.  We provide results showing how sensitive
    ESP is to the number and type of static features and programs included in
    the ESP training sets, and we compare the efficacy of static branch
    prediction for subroutine libraries. Averaging over a body of 43 C and
    Fortran programs, ESP branch prediction results in a miss rate of 20\%, as
    compared with the 25\% miss rate obtained using the best existing
    program-based heuristics.",

   "Tree induction is one of the most effective and widely used methods for
    building classification models. However, many applications require cases to
    be ranked by the probability of class membership. Probability estimation
    trees (PETs) have the same attractive features as classification trees
    (e.g., comprehensibility, accuracy and efficiency in high dimensions and on
    large data sets). Unfortunately, decision trees have been found to provide
    poor probability estimates. Several techniques have been proposed to build
    more accurate PETs, but, to our knowledge, there has not been a systematic
    experimental analysis of which techniques actually improve the
    probability-based rankings, and by how much. In this paper we first discuss
    why the decision-tree representation is not intrinsically inadequate for
    probability estimation. Inaccurate probabilities are partially the result
    of decision-tree induction algorithms that focus on maximizing
    classification accuracy and minimizing tree size (for example via
    reduced-error pruning). Larger trees can be better for probability
    estimation, even if the extra size is superfluous for accuracy
    maximization. We then present the results of a comprehensive set of
    experiments, testing some straightforward methods for improving
    probability-based rankings. We show that using a simple, common smoothing
    method?the Laplace correction?uniformly improves probability-based
    rankings. In addition, bagging substantially improves the rankings, and is
    even more effective for this purpose than for improving accuracy. We
    conclude that PETs, with these simple modifications, should be considered
    when rankings based on class-membership probability are required.",

    however, poses several challenges. First and foremost, it is necessary to
    model the extraction of any relevant dynamic information from execution
    traces, thus avoiding to collect a large amount of unmanageable
    data. Second, we need a distributed architecture that allows to collect and
    compress such an information from geographically distributed users. We
    propose a probabilistic model for representing dynamic information, as well
    as a Web-service based distributed architecture for its collection and
    compression. The new architecture has been instantiated to collect
    inter-procedural program execution traces up to a selectable level of
    calling context sensitivity. The paper details the role and

    useful data analysis and transformation tools are not readily

    systems administrators, computational biologists, financial analysts and
    hosts of others on a regular basis. In this paper, we demonstrate that
    it is possible to generate a suite of useful data processing tools,
    including a semi-structured query engine, several format converters, a
    statistical analyzer and data visualization routines directly from the
    ad hoc data itself, without any human intervention. The key technical
    contribution of the work is a multi-phase algorithm that automatically
    infers the structure of an ad hoc data source and produces a format
    specification in the PADS data description language. Programmers wishing
    to implement custom data analysis tools can use such descriptions to
    generate printing and parsing libraries for the data. Alternatively, our
    software infrastructure will push these descriptions through the PADS
    compiler, creating format-dependent modules that, when linked with
    format-independent algorithms for analysis and transformation, result
    in fully functional tools. We evaluate the performance of our inference
    algorithm, showing it scales linearly in the size of the training data -
    completing in seconds, as opposed to the hours or days it takes to write
    a description by hand. We also evaluate the correctness of the
    algorithm, demonstrating that generating accurate descriptions often
    requires less than 5\% of the available data.",
