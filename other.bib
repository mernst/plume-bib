   "Like many engineering schools, MIT found itself faced with the challenge of
    providing engineering students with an educational program that develops an
    ever-broader range of technical and nontechnical abilities. With the
    primary curriculum already overloaded, the School took an alternative
    approach. Launched in 2002, the Undergraduate Practice Opportunities
    Program (UPOP) is a new co-curricular program for sophomores that provides
    professional engineering experience and develops students non-technical
    professional abilities. The UPOP program goal is to integrate three
    essential parts of effective learning: knowledge, experience, and
    reflection. UPOP consists of: 1) Knowledge 1- The program begins with an
    intensive week of engineering practice ``boot camp'' during the January
    intersession and is led by engineering and management faculty. Through
    active case-based and role-playing learning sessions, students gain
    practical knowledge and appreciation for interpersonal and presentation
    skills, leadership, professional ethics, organizational dynamics, product
    development, and statistical quality control; 2) Knowledge 2- In Spring,
    students attend alumni-led workshops on career development; 3) Experience-
    In Summer, students complete 12 weeks of employment where they will be able
    to realize UPOP s educational objectives; 4) Reflection 1- During Summer,
    students complete a structured journal that permits exploration of
    engineering teamwork, communication, and organization; 5) Reflection 2- In
    Fall, students meet to discuss their experiences with other students and
    faculty. Assessment and evaluation of the new program included activity
    feedback surveys, student pre- and postactivity ability self-assessment
    surveys completed by UPOP students and a control group, employer survey of
    student performance, and performance scoring of student journals. Analysis
    of data revealed student improvement in many key non-technical professional
    abilities such as teamwork, presentation, identification of customer needs
    as part of the product development process, and comprehension of
    organization dynamics and strategy concepts compared with the control
    group.",

   "This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a
    computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers
    familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and
    a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is
    the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error
    interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a
    resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details
    and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central
    issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and
    exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision
    theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models
    to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and
    coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented
    systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for
    reinforcement learning."

   "Programs that manipulate physical quantities typically represent these
    quantities as raw numbers corresponding to the quantities' measurements in
    particular units (e.g., a length represented as a number of meters). This
    approach eliminates the possibility of catching errors resulting from
    adding or comparing quantities expressed in different units (as in the Mars
    Climate Orbiter error [11]), and does not support the safe comparison and
    addition of quantities of the same dimension. We show how to formulate
    dimensions and units as classes in a nominally typed object-oriented
    language through the use of statically typed metaclasses. Our formulation
    allows both parametric and inheritance polymorphism with respect to both
    dimension and unit types. It also allows for integration of encapsulated
    measurement systems, dynamic conversion factors, declarations of scales
    (including nonlinear scales) with defined zeros, and nonconstant exponents
    on dimension types. We also show how to encapsulate most of the ``magic
    machinery'' that handles the algebraic nature of dimensions and units in a
    single meta-class that allows us to treat select static types as generators
    of a free abelian group.",

    many potential uses in program performance tuning, profile-directed
    compilation, and software test coverage. This paper describes a new
    algorithm for path profiling. This simple, fast algorithm selects and
    places profile instrumentation to minimize run-time overhead. Instrumented
    programs run with overhead comparable to the best previous profiling
    techniques. On the SPEC95 benchmarks, path profiling overhead averaged 31%,
    as compared to 16% for efficient edge profiling. Path profiling also
    identifies longer paths than a previous technique, which predicted paths
    from edge profiles (average of 88, versus 34 instructions). Moreover,
    profiling shows that the SPEC95 train input datasets covered most of the
    paths executed in the ref datasets.",

   "Languages such as Java and C#, as well as scripting languages like Python,
    and Ruby, make extensive use of Collection classes.
    \par
    A collection implementation represents a fixed choice in the dimensions of
    operation time, space utilization, and synchronization. Using the
    collection in a manner not consistent with this fixed choice can cause
    significant performance degradation.
    \par
    In this paper, we present Chameleon, a low-overhead automatic tool that
    assists the programmer in choosing the appropriate collection
    implementation for her application. During program execution, Chameleon
    computes elaborate trace and heap-based metrics on collection
    behavior. These metrics are consumed on-thefly by a rules engine which
    outputs a list of suggested collection adaptation strategies. The tool can
    apply these corrective strategies automatically or present them to the
    programmer.
    \par
    We have implemented Chameleon on top of a IBM's J9 production JVM, and
    evaluated it over a small set of benchmarks. We show that for some
    applications, using Chameleon leads to a significant improvement of the
    memory footprint of the application.",
