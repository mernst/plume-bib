                 at the Oregon Graduate Institute during the Fall term,
                 1994. The Practicum is a result of a partnership
                 between industry and academia, quality practitioner and
                 theoretically oriented professor. It is structured to
                 meet both short-term training and long-term education
                 needs. The Software Process Practicum is a unique and
                 highly effective course covering the `hard' issues
                 (quality processes), the `soft' issues (social
                 processes), and specific techniques that require
                 merging the two. The students who took the first
                 offering of the Software Process Practicum have used in
                 their work environment the concepts and techniques we
                 taught in the classroom. They are continuing to
                 demonstrate objective evidence of improvement on

                 confirming that it is not only possible, but that it
                 can be done well, and that a university course can
                 provide significant opportunities to its students to
                 make a difference in the professional community. This
                 paper covers the following areas: * The background of
                 the Software Process Practicum and the premises on
                 which it is designed * The overall Practicum framework
                 and modules taught * An overview of the Software Skills
                 and Competency Model on which the Practicum is based *
                 The impact the course has had on some of our students
                 and the results that they, and the organizations for

   "This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a
    computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers
    familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and
    a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is
    the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error
    interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a
    resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details
    and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central
    issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and
    exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision
    theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models
    to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and
    coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented
    systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for
    reinforcement learning."

   "Programs that manipulate physical quantities typically represent these
    quantities as raw numbers corresponding to the quantities' measurements in
    particular units (e.g., a length represented as a number of meters). This
    approach eliminates the possibility of catching errors resulting from
    adding or comparing quantities expressed in different units (as in the Mars
    Climate Orbiter error [11]), and does not support the safe comparison and
    addition of quantities of the same dimension. We show how to formulate
    dimensions and units as classes in a nominally typed object-oriented
    language through the use of statically typed metaclasses. Our formulation
    allows both parametric and inheritance polymorphism with respect to both
    dimension and unit types. It also allows for integration of encapsulated
    measurement systems, dynamic conversion factors, declarations of scales
    (including nonlinear scales) with defined zeros, and nonconstant exponents
    on dimension types. We also show how to encapsulate most of the ``magic
    machinery'' that handles the algebraic nature of dimensions and units in a
    single meta-class that allows us to treat select static types as generators
    of a free abelian group.",

    many potential uses in program performance tuning, profile-directed
    compilation, and software test coverage. This paper describes a new
    algorithm for path profiling. This simple, fast algorithm selects and
    places profile instrumentation to minimize run-time overhead. Instrumented
    programs run with overhead comparable to the best previous profiling
    techniques. On the SPEC95 benchmarks, path profiling overhead averaged 31\%,
    as compared to 16\% for efficient edge profiling. Path profiling also
    identifies longer paths than a previous technique, which predicted paths
    from edge profiles (average of 88, versus 34 instructions). Moreover,
    profiling shows that the SPEC95 train input datasets covered most of the
    paths executed in the ref datasets.",

    A collection implementation represents a fixed choice in the dimensions of
    operation time, space utilization, and synchronization. Using the
    collection in a manner not consistent with this fixed choice can cause
    significant performance degradation.
    \par
    In this paper, we present Chameleon, a low-overhead automatic tool that
    assists the programmer in choosing the appropriate collection
    implementation for her application. During program execution, Chameleon
    computes elaborate trace and heap-based metrics on collection
    behavior. These metrics are consumed on-thefly by a rules engine which
    outputs a list of suggested collection adaptation strategies. The tool can
    apply these corrective strategies automatically or present them to the
    programmer.
    \par
    We have implemented Chameleon on top of a IBM's J9 production JVM, and
    evaluated it over a small set of benchmarks. We show that for some
    applications, using Chameleon leads to a significant improvement of the
    memory footprint of the application.",

    study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question,
    and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the
    relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a
    research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a
    field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater
    number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is
    greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical
    modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice;
    and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of
    statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and
    settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than
    true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research
    findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In
    this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct

   "Guidelines for designing information charts (such as bar charts) often
    state that the presentation should reduce or remove 'chart junk' - visual
    embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data. In
    contrast, some popular chart designers wrap the presented data in detailed
    and elaborate imagery, raising the questions of whether this imagery is
    really as detrimental to understanding as has been proposed, and whether
    the visual embellishment may have other benefits. To investigate these
    issues, we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with
    plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term
    recall. We found that people's accuracy in describing the embellished
    charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a
    two-to-three-week gap was significantly better. Although we are cautious
    about recommending that all charts be produced in this style, our results
    question some of the premises of the minimalist approach to chart design."
