abstract = "Distributed symbolic computations involve the existence of
{\em remote references} allowing an object, local to a processor, to
designate another object located on another processor. To reclaim
inaccessible objects is the non trivial task of a distributed Garbage
Collector (GC).  We present in this paper a new distributed GC algorithm
which
\begin{localenumerate}
\item is fault-tolerant,
\item is largely independent of how a processor garbage collects its
      own data space,
\item does not need centralized control nor global stop-the-world
      synchronization,
\item allows for multiple concurrent active GCs,
\item does not require to migrate objects from processor to processor and
\item eventually reclaims all inaccessible objects including
      distributed cycles.
\end{localenumerate}
\par
These results are mainly obtained through the concept of a {\em group}
of processors (or processes).
 Processors of a same group cooperate together to a GC inside this group;
this GC is conservative with respect to the outside of the group.
 A processor contributes to the global GC of all groups to which it
belongs. Garbage collection on small groups reclaims quickly locally
distributed garbage clusters, while garbage collection on large groups
ultimately reclaims widely distributed garbage clusters, albeit more
slowly.
 Groups can be reorganized dynamically, in particular to tolerate
failures of some member processors.
 These properties make the algorithm usable on very large and evolving
networks of processors.
 Other than distributed symbolic computations, possible applications
include for example distributed file or database systems."

abstract = "Garbage Collection frees the programmer from the burden of
explicitly deallocating unused data. This facility induces a considerable
overhead but also causes some delays that may affect real-time
applications.  Guaranteed throughput (with at most short and
predictable delays) is needed in many applications such as plane or
plant control and requires at least a worst case analysis to identify
the performances of the whole system.  Traditional GC are made of two
phases~: the marker which identifies all useful data, followed by the
sweeper which reclaims all useless data.  On-the-fly GC schemes were
introduced to permit an application and a collector to run
concurrently. That concurrency may lessen the GC penalty incurred by
the application.
\par
We present here a new algorithm where the application,
the marker and the sweeper are concurrent. The benefit is to tightly
adjust collection rate to application consumption and have an allocation
time bounded by a small constant. Moreover our algorithm does not waste memory
and appears to be well suited for embedded systems.
\par
This ``mark {\sc during} sweep'' algorithm is completely presented.  An
interesting single-processor and incremental realisation is also
analysed and followed by  some implementation variations."
