   "Automatic identification of the differences between two versions of a file is a
    common and basic task in several applications of mining code repositories. Git,
    a version control system, has a diff utility and users can select algorithms of
    diff from the default algorithm Myers to the advanced Histogram algorithm. From
    our systematic mapping, we identified three popular applications of diff in
    recent studies. On the impact on code churn metrics in 14 Java projects, we
    obtained different values in 1.7\% to 8.2\% commits based on the different diff
    algorithms. Regarding bug-introducing change identification, we found 6.0\% and
    13.3\% in the identified bug-fix commits had different results of
    bug-introducing changes from 10 Java projects. For patch application, we found
    that the Histogram is more suitable than Myers for providing the changes of
    code, from our manual analysis. Thus, we strongly recommend using the Histogram
    algorithm when mining Git repositories to consider differences in source code.",

abstract = {Analyzing and understanding source code changes is important in a variety of software maintenance tasks. To this end, many code differencing and code change summarization methods have been proposed. For some tasks (e.g. code review and software merging), however, those differencing methods generate too fine-grained a representation of code changes, and those summarization methods generate too coarse-grained a representation of code changes. Moreover, they do not consider the relationships among code changes. Therefore, the generated differences or summaries make it not easy to analyze and understand code changes in some software maintenance tasks. In this paper, we propose a code differencing approach, named CLDIFF, to generate concise linked code differences whose granularity is in between the existing code differencing and code change summarization methods. The goal of CLDIFF is to generate more easily understandable code differences. CLDIFF takes source code files before and after changes as inputs, and consists of three steps. First, it pre-processes the source code files by pruning unchanged declara- tions from the parsed abstract syntax trees. Second, it generates concise code differences by grouping fine-grained code differences at or above the statement level and describing high-level changes in each group. Third, it links the related concise code differences according to five pre-defined links. Experiments with 12 Java projects (74,387 commits) and a human study with 10 participants have indicated the accuracy, conciseness, performance and usefulness of CLDIFF.},

abstract = {Code velocity, or the speed with which code changes are integrated into a production environment, plays a crucial role in Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. Many studies report factors influencing code velocity. However, solutions to increase code velocity are unclear. Meanwhile, the industry continues to issue guidelines on "ideal" code change size, believing it increases code velocity despite lacking evidence validating the practice. Surprisingly, this fundamental question has not been studied to date. This study investigates the practicality of improving code velocity by optimizing pull request size and composition (ratio of insertions, deletions, and modifications).
\par
We start with a hypothesis that a moderate correlation exists between pull request size and time-to-merge. We selected 100 most popular, actively developed projects from 10 programming languages on GitHub. We analyzed our dataset of 845,316 pull requests by size, composition, and context to explore its relationship to time-to-merge---a proxy to measure code velocity. Our study shows that pull request size and composition do not relate to time-to-merge. Regardless of the contextual factors that can influence pull request size or composition (e.g., programming language), the observation holds. Pull request data from two other platforms: Gerrit and Phabricator (401,790 code reviews) confirms the lack of relationship. This negative result as in "...eliminate useless hypotheses ..." [75] challenges a widespread belief by showing that small code changes do not merge faster to increase code velocity.},

abstract = {During the software development process, several developers commonly change artifacts in parallel. A merge process can combine parallel changes. In the case of changes that cannot be automatically combined, the developer responsible for the merge must reconcile decisions and resolve conflicts. Some studies are concerned with investigating ways to deal with merge conflicts and measuring the effort that this activity may require. However, the investigation of factors that may reduce the occurrence of conflicts needs more and deeper attention. This paper aims at identifying and analyzing attributes of past merges with and without conflicts to understand what may induce physical conflicts. We analyzed 182,273 merge scenarios from 80 projects written in eight different programming languages to find characteristics that increase the chances of a merge to have a conflict. We found that attributes such as the number of committers, the number of commits, and the number of changed files seem to have the biggest influence in the occurrence of merge conflicts. Moreover, attributes in the branch that is being integrated seem to be more influential than the same attributes in the other branch. Additionally, we discovered positive correlations between the occurrence of conflicts and both the duration of the branch and the intersection of developers.},

How this parallel development is structured and supported has a profound effect on both the quality and timeliness of the product. We conduct an observational case study in which we collect and analyze the change and configuration management history of a legacy system to delineate the boundaries of, and to understand the nature of, the problems encountered in parallel development. The results of our studies are (1) that the degree of parallelism is very high -- higher than considered by tool builders; (2) there are multiple levels of parallelism, and the data for some important aspects are uniform and consistent for all levels; (3) the tails of the distributions are long, indicating the tail, rather than the mean, must receive serious attention in providing solutions for these problems; and (4) there is a significant correlation between the degree of parallel work on a given component and the number of quality problems it has. Thus, the results of this study are important both for tool builders and for process and project engineers.},

   "Version control of tree structures, ubiquitous in software engineering, is
    typically performed on a textual encoding of the trees, rather than the trees

    encodings leads to inaccurate diffs, unnecessary conflicts, and incorrect
    merges. To address these problems, we propose novel algorithms for computing
    precise diffs between two versions of a tree and for three-way merging of
    trees. Unlike most other approaches for version control of structured data,
    our approach integrates with mainstream version control systems. Our merge
    algorithm can be customized for specific application domains to further
    improve merge results. An evaluation of our approach on abstract syntax trees
    from popular Java projects shows substantially improved merge results

abstract = {In order to ease content enrichment, exchange, and sharing, web-scale collaborative platforms such as Wikipedia or Google Docs enable unbounded interactions between a large number of contributors, without prior knowledge of their level of expertise and reliability. Version control is then essential for keeping track of the evolution of the shared content and its provenance. In such environments, uncertainty is ubiquitous due to the unreliability of the sources, the incompleteness and imprecision of the contributions, the possibility of malicious editing and vandalism acts, etc. To handle this uncertainty, we use a probabilistic XML model as a basic component of our version control framework. Each version of a shared document is represented by an XML tree and the whole document, together with its different versions, is modeled as a probabilistic XML document. Uncertainty is evaluated using the probabilistic model and the reliability measure associated to each source, each contributor, or each editing event, resulting in an uncertainty measure on each version and each part of the document. We show that standard version control operations can be implemented directly as operations on the probabilistic XML model; efficiency with respect to deterministic version control systems is demonstrated on real-world datasets.},

abstract = {In recent years, models are increasingly used throughout the entire lifecycle in software engineering projects. In effect, the need for collaboration and for management of change on these models emerged. Traditionally, Software Configuration Management (SCM) systems are employed to facilitate collaboration on software engineering artifacts and to control change to these artifacts. For scalability and to support offline operation, most of these systems employ optimistic concurrency control and therefore require methods to detect concurrent change---also known as conflict detection. However, many researchers have shown that existing approaches for SCM systems do not work well on graph-like models, since they are geared towards textual artifacts and do not take the graph structure of models into account. The approaches for conflict detection in these systems show many false positives, since they require a merge every time the same configuration item --- in this case the same file --- is changed. In this paper, we propose operation-based conflict detection, which detects conflicts directly on the operations that change the model. We compare operation-based conflict detection to file-based conflict detection in a multi-case study and show that operation-based conflict detection results in less conflicts and therefore requires fewer merges.},

Tool support for collaboration on models is therefore crucial. Traditionally Software Configuration Management (SCM) systems such as RCS [9] or Subversion [10] have supported this task for textual artifacts such as source code on the granularity of files and textual lines. They do not work well for graph-like models with many links since the granularity needed to support them is on the level of model elements and their attributes. For the design of a novel SCM system addressing these requirements it is essential to define how conflicts on models are detected and how they can be resolved. In this paper we present an approach to conflict detection and resolution on models. We employ operation-based change tracking and therefore detect conflicts based on operations. For conflict resolution we propose an integration of SCM with techniques from Rational Management to effectively resolve conflicts.},

abstract = {Collaborative software development is an integral part of the modern software development life cycle, essential to the success of large-scale software projects. When multiple developers make concurrent changes around the same lines of code, a merge conflict may occur. Such conflicts stall pull requests and continuous integration pipelines for hours to several days, seriously hurting developer productivity. To address this problem, we introduce MergeBERT, a novel neural program merge framework based on token-level three-way differencing and a transformer encoder model. By exploiting the restricted nature of merge conflict resolutions, we reformulate the task of generating the resolution sequence as a classification task over a set of primitive merge patterns extracted from real-world merge commit data. Our model achieves 63-68% accuracy for merge resolution synthesis, yielding nearly a 3\texttimes{} performance improvement over existing semi-structured, and 2\texttimes{} improvement over neural program merge tools. Finally, we demonstrate that MergeBERT is sufficiently flexible to work with source code files in Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C# programming languages. To measure the practical use of MergeBERT, we conduct a user study to evaluate MergeBERT suggestions with 25 developers from large OSS projects on 122 real-world conflicts they encountered. Results suggest that in practice, MergeBERT resolutions would be accepted at a higher rate than estimated by automatic metrics for precision and accuracy. Additionally, we use participant feedback to identify future avenues for improvement of MergeBERT.},

abstract = {Even though many programmers rely on 3-way merge tools to integrate changes from different branches, such tools can introduce subtle bugs in the integration process. This paper aims to mitigate this problem by defining a semantic notion of conflict-freedom, which ensures that the merged program does not introduce new unwanted behaviors. We also show how to verify this property using a novel, compositional algorithm that combines lightweight summarization for shared program fragments with precise relational reasoning for the modifications. Towards this goal, our method uses a 4-way differencing algorithm on abstract syntax trees to represent different program versions as edits applied to a shared program with holes. This representation allows our verification algorithm to reason about different edits in isolation and compose them to obtain an overall proof of conflict freedom. We have implemented the proposed technique in a new tool called SafeMerge for Java and evaluate it on 52 real-world merge scenarios obtained from GitHub. The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over syntactic conflict-freedom and indicate that SafeMerge is both precise and practical.},

The software should enable the end-user to decipher the critical version information about the minutest detail in every software artifact and if it does not, no software can be called as complete or nor is it user-friendly. When developers check in the software files they have to put in the version field manually as a part of header information inside the file. It would be difficult to identify vulnerabilities in the software when the files lack embedded version information which makes it harder for the end users to accurately identify the running version of the software. How can version control system (VCS) help in optimizing the bug traceability time and bug fixing potential? Version control system (VCS) is a software application that helps in collaborative software development of software projects. In order to support this instance, we should analyze which version control system is to be considered and whether to use central repository version control system or local repository version control system. Various functional, non functional evaluation criteria and fundamental requirements like installation, configuration, learning curve, performance, commits, branching, merging, and tagging have been considered for a through comparison of many version control systems. In this paper, we review and analyze the currently used VCS that involved in a view of a collaborative software development for software evolution. And an attempt has also been made to identify the version information in every deliverable file or retain it with the source. We demonstrate and perform survey on current versioning systems like Concurrent Version Control System (CVS), Subversion (SVN), Team Foundation Server (TFS), Git, ACME, Visual Source Safe(VSS), Mercurial and Clear Case, etc. that offers opportunities to test produced results and validate.},

Semistructured merge tools go further by partially exploring the syntactic structure of code artifacts, and, as a consequence, obtaining significant merge accuracy gains for Java-like languages. To understand whether semistructured merge and the observed gains generalize to other kinds of languages, we implement two semistructured merge tools for JavaScript, and compare them to an unstructured tool. We find that current semistructured merge algorithms and frameworks are not directly applicable for scripting languages like JavaScript. By adapting the algorithms, and studying 10,345 merge scenarios from 50 JavaScript projects on GitHub, we find evidence that our JavaScript tools report fewer spurious conflicts than unstructured merge, without compromising the correctness of the merging process. The gains, however, are much smaller than the ones observed for Java-like languages, suggesting that semistructured merge advantages might be limited for languages that allow both commutative and non-commutative declarations at the same syntactic level.},

When the contributions happen at the same physical region in the source code, the merge is marked as conflicting and must be manually resolved by the developers. Existing studies explore why conflicts happen, their characteristics, and how they are resolved. In this paper, we investigate a specific subset of merge conflicts, which may be resolved using a combination of existing lines. We analyze 10,177 conflict chunks of popular projects that were resolved by combining existing lines, aiming at characterizing and finding patterns that developers frequently use to resolve them. We found that these conflicting chunks and their resolutions are usually small (they have a median of 6 LOC and 3 LOC, respectively). Moreover, 98.6% of the analyzed resolutions preserve the order of the lines in the conflicting chunks. We also found that 77.4% of the chunk resolutions do not interleave lines from different contributions more than once. These findings altogether, when used as heuristics for automatic merge resolution, could enable the reduction of the search space by 94.7%, paving the road for future search-based software engineering tools for this problem.},

Developers use software merging tools, but if such tools return results with too many conflicts and errors, this activity becomes even more difficult. To help developers, several algorithms have been proposed to improve the automation of merge tools. These algorithms aim at minimising conflict situations and therefore improving the productivity of the development team, however no general framework is proposed to evaluated and compare their result.This paper proposes a methodology to measure the effort required to use the result of a given merge tool. We employ the large number of publicly available open-source development histories to automatically compute this measure and evaluate the quality of the merging tools results. We use the simple idea that these histories contains both the concurrent modifications and their merge results as approved by the developers. Through a study of six open-source repositories totalling more than 2.5 millions lines of code, we show meaningful comparison results between merge algorithms and how to use the results to improve them.},

    propose CoRA (<u>Co</u>de <u>R</u>eview <u>A</u>ssistant), an automatic
    approach to decompose a commit into different parts and generate concise
    descriptions for reviewers. More specifically, CoRA can decompose a commit
    into independent parts (e.g., bug fixing, new feature adding, or
    refactoring) by code dependency analysis and tree-based similar-code
    detection, then identify the most important code changes in each part based
    on the PageRank algorithm and heuristic rules. As a result, CoRA can
    generate a concise description for each part of the commit. We evaluate our
    approach in seven open source software projects and 50 code commits. The
    results indicate that CoRA can improve the accuracy of decomposing code
    changes by 6.3\% over the state-of-art practice. At the same time, CoRA can
    identify the important part from the fine-grained code changes with a mean
    average precision (MAP) of 87.7\%. We also conduct a human study with eight
    participants to evaluate the performance and usefulness of CoRA, the user

   "During software evolution, developers make several changes and commit them
    into the repositories. Unfortunately, many of them tangle different
    purposes, both hampering program comprehension and reducing separation of
    concerns. Automated approaches with deterministic solutions have been
    proposed to untangle commits. However, specifying an effective clustering
    criteria on the changes in a commit for untangling is challenging for those
    approaches. In this work, we present UTango, a machine learning (ML)-based
    approach that learns to untangle the changes in a commit. We develop a
    novel code change clustering learning model that learns to cluster the code
    changes, represented by the embeddings, into different groups with
    different concerns. We adapt the agglomerative clustering algorithm into a
    supervised-learning clustering model operating on the learned code change
    embeddings via trainable parameters and a loss function in comparing the
    predicted clusters and the correct ones during training. To facilitate our
    clustering learning model, we develop a context-aware, graph-based, code
    change representation learning model, leveraging Label, Graph-based
    Convolution Network to produce the contextualized embeddings for code
    changes, that integrates program dependencies and the surrounding contexts
    of the changes. The contexts and cloned code are also explicitly
    represented, helping UTango distinguish the concerns. Our empirical
    evaluation on C# and Java datasets with 1,612 and 14k tangled commits show
    that it achieves the accuracy of 28.6\%--462.5\% and 13.3\%--100.0\%

   "When interacting with source control management system, developers often
    commit unrelated or loosely related code changes in a single
    transaction. When analyzing version histories, such tangled changes will
    make all changes to all modules appear related, possibly compromising the
    resulting analyses through noise and bias. In an investigation of five
    open-source JAVA projects, we found between 7\% and 20\% of all bug fixes
    to consist of multiple tangled changes. Using a multi-predictor approach to
    untangle changes, we show that on average at least 16.6\% of all source
    files are incorrectly associated with bug reports. These incorrect bug file
    associations seem to not significantly impact models classifying source
    files to have at least one bug or no bugs. But our experiments show that
    untangling tangled code changes can result in more accurate regression bug
    prediction models when compared to models trained and tested on tangled bug
    datasets—in our experiments, the statistically significant accuracy
    improvements lies between 5\% and 200\%. We recommend better change
    organization to limit the impact of tangled changes."

Features, in this context, denote configurable system options that users select when creating customized kernel images. The provided dataset is the largest corpus we are aware of capturing feature additions and removals, allowing researchers to assess the kernel evolution from a feature-oriented point-of-view. Furthermore, the dataset can be used to better understand how features evolve over time, and how different artifacts change as a result. One particular use of the dataset is to provide a real-world case to assess existing support for feature traceability and evolution. In this paper, we detail the dataset extraction process, the underlying database schema, and example queries.

However, the complexity of these changes cause versioning tools that operate at a file level to lose the history of entities and be unable to merge refactored entities. This problem can be solved by semantic, operation-based SCM with persistent IDs. We propose that versioning tools be aware of program entities and refactoring operations. We present MolhadoRef, our prototype, which uses these techniques to ensure that it never loses history. MolhadoRef can successfully merge edit and refactoring operations which were performed on different development branches.},

To this aim, for each Java file under versioning, an XML-based file representing the logical structure of the original file is automatically built by parsing the code. An additional XML-based file is also built to model collaboration constraints. This information is useful to enrich the context awareness by providing developers information about changes made by others to the same logical unit (i.e., class, method, or attribute) of the Java file. Finally, we present an extension of Subclipse, a Subversion front-end implemented as an Eclipse plug-in, aiming to support the fine-grained versioning in Subversion.},

abstract = {As Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSML) become more widespread, it is now possible for non-computer scientists to design complex systems. Not only do DSMLs make modeling more accessible to domain experts, they also improve their efficiency. Using such models, the problem of their maintenance and evolution arises, with common software engineering issues, such as reversibility and traceability of developments.In this article we present the integration of a collaborative edition process into a model-driven engineering (MDE) simulation platform defining its own DSML, which includes a serialization procedure. Our novel approach defines a collaborative work and version control process. This process uses the concrete textual syntax defined by this DSML, which allows us to use the features of existing Version Control Systems (VCS) to work with serialized models, and helps calculate the differences between two versions of a model, merge versions of these models, and detect merge conflicts.},

Hypermedia structures are managed separately from documents' contents. Molhado explicitly represents hyperlinks, allowing them to be browsed, visualized, and systematically analyzed. Molhado not only versions complex hypermedia structures (e.g., multi links), but also supports versioning of individual hyperlinks. This paper focuses on Molhado's hypertext versioning and its use in the Software Concordance environment to manage the evolution of a software project and hypermedia structures.},

However, these tools are unlikely to be adopted by non-technical document authors due to the overhead of managing a repository and the tools' learning curves.This paper presents an approach called version-aware documents that embeds versioning data within the document thus making version control for single documents a seamless part of the authoring process.},

abstract = {Modern systems need to run in many different contexts like hardware and software platforms or environmental conditions. Additionally different customers might have slightly different requirements towards systems. Therefore software systems need to be highly configurable and provide variable sets of features for different customers. There are various approaches to developing and managing such systems, like ad-hoc clone-and-own approaches or structured software product line approaches for each of which again several different techniques and tools exist to support them. While the different approaches come with advantages they also have several disadvantages and shortcomings. Some work only with specific implementation artifacts (e.g. source code but not models) and others exist only as plugins for specific IDEs which makes them intrusive or even unusable in some development environments. In our work we present a development process and tools for managing and engineering of highly configurable and variable systems that is generic, incremental, flexible and intuitive. We evaluated our approach on several case study systems from various different domains and origins like open source, academia or industry. The results so far showed promising results.},
