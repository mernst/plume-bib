   "Program understanding can be assisted by tools that match patterns in the
    program source. Lexical pattern matchers provide excellent performance and
    ease of use, but have a limited vocabulary. Syntactic matchers provide more
    precision, but may sacrifice performance, retargetability, ease of use, or
    generality.
    \par
    To achieve more of the benefits of both models, we extend the pattern
    syntax of awk to support matching of abstract syntax trees, as demonstrated
    in a tool called tawk. Its pattern syntax is language-independent, based on
    abstract tree patterns. As in awk, patterns can have associated actions,
    which in tawk are written in C for generality, familiarity, and
    performance. The use of C is simplified by high-level libraries and dynamic
    linking. To allow processing of program files containing non-syntactic
    constructs, mechanisms have been designed that allow transparent matching
    in a syntactic fashion. So far, tawk has been retargeted to the MUMPS and C
    programming languages.
    \par
    We survey and apply prototypical approaches to concretely demonstrate the
    tradeoffs. Our results indicate that tawk can be used to quickly and easily
    perform a variety of common software engineering tasks, and the extensions
    to accommodate non-syntactic features significantly extend the generality
    of syntactic matchers."

   "The C language is among the most widely used in the world, particularly for
    critical infrastructure software. C programs depend upon macros processed
    using the C preprocessor, but these macros are difficult to analyze and are
    often error-prone[4]. Existing tools that analyze and transform C source
    code have rudimentary support for the preprocessor, leading to obscure
    error messages and difficulty refactoring. We present a three part
    solution:  (1) a replacement macro language, ASTEC, that addresses the most
    important important deficiencies of the preprocessor and that eliminates
    many of the errors it introduces; (2) a translator, MACROSCOPE, that
    converts existing code into ASTEC semi-automatically; and (3), an
    ASTEC-aware refactoring tool that handles preprocessor constructs
    naturally.
    \par
    ASTEC's primary benefits are its analyzability and its refactorability. We
    present several refactorings that are enabled by ASTEC. Additionally, ASTEC
    eliminates many of the sources of errors that can plague C preprocessor
    macros; Ernst et al.[4] estimate that more than 20\% of macros may contain
    errors. In this paper, we describe our translation and refactoring tools
    and evaluate them on a suite of programs including OpenSSH and the Linux
    kernel."

                 into any number of functionally independent debugging
                 units. Conditional compilation of each unit is
                 controlled by a separate compile time switch. Execution
                 of each compiled unit is controlled by a separate run
                 time switch. Efficient final products can be generated
                 by turning off compile time switches of all debugging
                 units. This packaging method depends on the C
                 preprocessor and its final refinement depends on the
                 ability of the compiler to perform 'dead code removal'

                 routines can be parameterized independently of other
                 routines. Run time options of library routines can be
                 changed without access to their source code. This
                 parameterization is not restricted to debugging code.
                 The same mechanism may be used to select one of several
                 implementations of a feature, or to set initial values
                 of variables.",
