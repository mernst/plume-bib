                 decision trees from data, for the purposes of
                 classification and prediction. After a comprehensive,
                 multi-disciplinary survey of work on decision trees,
                 some algorithmic extensions to existing tree growing
                 methods are considered. The implications of using (1)
                 less greedy search and (2) less restricted splits at
                 tree nodes are systematically studied. Extending the
                 traditional axis-parallel splits to {\it oblique}
                 splits is shown to be practical and beneficial for a
                 variety of problems. However, the use of more extensive
                 search heuristics than the traditional greedy heuristic
                 is argued to be unnecessary, and often harmful. Any
                 effort to build good decision trees from real-world
                 data involves ``massaging'' the data into a suitable
                 form. Two forms of data massaging, domain-independent
                 and domain-specific, are distinguished in this work. A
                 new framework is outlined for the former, and the
                 importance of the latter is illustrated in the context
                 of two new, complex classification problems in
                 astronomy. Highly accurate and small decision tree
                 classifiers are built for both these problems through a
                 collaborative effort with astronomers.",

    multimethods in object-oriented languages. In this article, we propose a
    simple multimethod dispatch scheme based on compressed dispatch
    tables. This scheme is applicable to any object-oriented language using a
    method precedence order that satisfies a specific monotonous property
    (e.g., as Cecil and Dylan) and guarantees that dynamic dispatch is
    performed in constant time, the latter being a major requirement for some
    languages and applications. We provide efficient algorithms to build the
    dispatch tables, provide their worst-case complexity, and demonstrate the
    effectiveness of our scheme by real measurements performed on two large
    object-oriented applications. Finally, we provide a detailed comparison of
    our technique with other existing techniques.",

                 search-control heuristics for logic programs, which can
                 be used to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of
                 knowledge-based systems expressed as definite-clause
                 logic programs. The approach combines techniques of
                 explanation- based learning and recent advances in
                 inductive logic programming to learn clause-selection
                 heuristics that guide program execution. Two specific
                 applications of this framework are detailed: dynamic
                 optimization of Prolog programs (improving efficiency)
                 and natural language acquisition (improving accuracy).
                 In the area of program optimization, a prototype
                 system, DOLPHIN is able to transform some intractable
                 specifications into polynomial-time algorithms, and
                 outperforms competing approaches in several benchmark
                 speedup domains. A prototype language acquisition
                 system, CHILL is also described. It is capable of
                 automatically acquiring semantic grammars, which
                 uniformly incorporate syntactic and semantic
                 constraints to parse sentences into case-role
                 representations. Initial experiments show that this
                 approach is able to construct accurate parsers which
                 generalize well to novel sentences and significantly
                 outperform previous approaches to learning case-role
                 mapping based on connectionist techniques. Planned
                 extensions of the general framework and the specific
                 applications as well as plans for further evaluation
                 are also discussed.",

   "Predicate dispatch is an object-oriented (OO) language
    mechanism for determining the method implementation to be invoked
    upon a message send. With predicate dispatch, each method
    implementation includes a predicate guard specifying the
    conditions under which the method should be invoked, and logical
    implication of predicates determines the method overriding
    relation. Predicate dispatch naturally unifies and generalizes
    several common forms of dynamic dispatch, including traditional OO
    dispatch, multimethod dispatch, and functional-style pattern
    matching. Unfortunately, prior languages supporting predicate
    dispatch have had several deficiencies that limit its utility in
    practice.
    \par
    We introduce JPred, a backward-compatible extension
    to Java supporting predicate dispatch. While prior languages with
    predicate dispatch have been extensions to toy or non-mainstream
    languages, we show how predicate dispatch can be naturally added
    to a traditional OO language. While prior languages with predicate
    dispatch have required the whole program to be available for
    typechecking and compilation, JPred retains Java's modular
    typechecking and compilation strategies. While prior languages
    with predicate dispatch have included special-purpose algorithms
    for reasoning about predicates, JPred employs general-purpose,
    off-the-shelf decision procedures. As a result, JPred's type
    system is more flexible, allowing several useful programming
    idioms that are spuriously rejected by those other languages.
    After describing the JPred language and type system, we present a
    case study illustrating the utility of JPred in a real-world
    application, including its use in the detection of several errors.",
