%% BibTeX abbreviations -- master file
%% Type "make" in the bib directory to process this with the bib-abbreviate
%%   script, which creates bibstring-{un}abbrev.bib.
%% Each string{...} entry may contain an extra ``= "..."'' element which is
%%   used as the abbreviation.

%%% See file mernst/abbreviations for the abbreviations available in the
%%% standard BibTeX styles (abbrev, alpha, plain, unsrt).

%%% Don't put cross references here; they should go after all references.
%%% A problem with cross references is that they don't just provide
%%% defaults:  the cross-referenced item shows up itself if it is
%%% referenced more than once.
