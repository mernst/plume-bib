   "Program slicing is a source-to-source transformation that has
    applications in construction, analysis, testing and debugging of programs.
    A program slice contains the portion of a program that captures some subset
    of the program behavior. Algorithms are available for constructing slices
    for a particular execution of a program (dynamic slices) as well as to
    approximate a subset of the behavior over all possible executions of a
    program (static slices). As the behavior of a program is determined by the
    semantics of the language, it is reasonable to expect a semantic
    justification for the practice of program slicing. Program slices have been
    used in several applications but there is no single notion of a slice that
    is useful for all applications.  The author identifies and categorizes
    different notions of a program slice available in the literature as well as
    several new notions. The various notions are formalized in a denotational
    framework."
